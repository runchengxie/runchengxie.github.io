*编者注：每周日，财富杂志都会从我们的档案中发布一篇最喜欢的故事。随着争议围绕着美联储主席本·伯南克是否低估了通货膨胀预期，我们回顾了1977年5月的及时建议，来自沃伦·巴菲特。奥马哈先知与伯南克在通货膨胀问题上一次又一次地发生冲突，这里巴菲特警告说，上涨的价格会阻碍经济增长“不是因为市场下跌，而是尽管市场上涨。”*

*Editor’s Note: Every Sunday, Fortune publishes a favorite story from our archive. As controversy swirls around whether Fed Chair Ben Bernanke is downplaying inflation predictions, we turn back to May 1977 for timely advice from Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha has clashed with Bernanke over inflation time and time again, and here Buffett warns how rising prices can hamper growth “not because the market falls, but in spite of the fact that the market rises.”*

众所周知，股票和债券在通货膨胀的环境中表现不佳。过去十年的大部分时间，我们就处在这样的环境中，这对股市来说确实是一段困难的时期。但是，股市在这段时期遇到的问题的原因仍然不太清楚。

It is no longer a secret that stocks, like bonds, do poorly in an inflationary environment. We have been in such an environment for most of the past decade, and it has indeed been a time of troubles for stocks. But the reasons for the stock market’s problems in this period are still imperfectly understood.

<br>

在通货膨胀时代，债券持有者的问题并不神秘。当美元的价值每个月都在下降时，一种以这些美元为收入和本金支付的证券不会是一个大赢家。你几乎不需要一个经济学博士来弄清楚这一点。

There is no mystery at all about the problems of bondholders in an era of inflation. When the value of the dollar deteriorates month after month, a security with income and principal payments denominated in those dollars isn’t going to be a big winner. You hardly need a Ph.D. in economics to figure that one out.

<br>

为什么事情没有按照这样的方式发展呢？我认为主要原因是，从经济实质上看，股票和债券非常相似。

And why didn’t it turn out that way? The main reason, I believe, is that stocks, in economic substance, are really very similar to bonds.

<br>

我知道这种信念对许多投资者来说会显得古怪。他们会立刻指出，债券的回报（票息）是固定的，而股权投资的回报（公司的盈利）则可能从一年到另一年有很大的变化。这是事实。但是任何一个研究过战后公司总体回报的人都会发现一个非凡的事实：实际上，股本回报并没有太大的变化。

I know that this belief will seem eccentric to many investors. They will immediately observe that the return on a bond (the coupon) is fixed, while the return on an equity investment (the company’s earnings) can vary substantially from one year to another. True enough. But anyone who examines the aggregate returns that have been earned by companies during the postwar years will discover something extraordinary: the returns on equity have in fact not varied much at all.

<br>

## 息票是有粘性的 The coupon is sticky

战后的前10年——即截至1955年的十年间——道琼斯工业指数的年末股权平均年回报率为12.8%。第二个十年，这个数字是10.1%。第三个十年，它是10.9%。一个更大的样本，财富500强（其历史只能追溯到20世纪50年代中期），显示了类似的结果：截至1965年的十年间，回报率为11.2%，截至1975年的十年间，回报率为11.8%。少数几年的数据要高得多（500强的最高值是1974年的14.1%）或低得多（1958年和1970年是9.5%），但多年来，在总体上，账面价值的回报率往往会回归到12%左右的水平。无论是在通货膨胀的年份（或者说在物价稳定的年份），这一水平都没有明显超过。 

In the first 10 years after the war — the decade ending in 1955 — the Dow Jones industrials had an average annual return on year-end equity of 12.8%. In the second decade, the figure was 10.1%. In the third decade it was 10.9%. Data for a larger universe, the Fortune 500 (whose history goes back only to the mid-1950s), indicate somewhat similar results: 11.2% in the decade ending in 1965, 11.8% in the decade through 1975. The figures for a few exceptional years have been substantially higher (the high for the 500 was 14.1% in 1974) or lower (9.5% in 1958 and 1970), but over the years, and in the aggregate, the return in book value tends to keep coming back to a level around 12%. It shows no signs of exceeding that level significantly in inflationary years (or in years of stable prices, for that matter).

<br>

我们暂时把这些公司，不是当作上市股票，而是当作生产企业。我们也假设这些企业的所有者是以账面价值购买的。在这种情况下，他们自己的回报率也会在12%左右。而且由于回报率非常稳定，把它看作是一个“股权票息”似乎是合理的。

For the moment, let’s think of those companies, not as listed stocks, but as productive enterprises. Let’s also assume that the owners of those enterprises had acquired them at book value. In that case, their own return would have been around 12% too. And because the return has been so consistent, it seems reasonable to think of it as an “equity coupon.”

<br>

在现实世界中，当然，投资股票的人不只是买了就不管。相反，许多人试图智胜同行，以便最大化自己的企业收益份额。这种无效的折腾，对股息券没有任何影响，但却降低了投资者的收益份额，因为他们承担了相当大的摩擦成本，如咨询费和经纪费。再加上一个活跃的期权市场，它对美国企业的生产力没有任何贡献，但却需要数千人来经营赌场，摩擦成本就更高了。

In the real world, of course, investors in stocks don’t just buy and hold. Instead, many try to outwit their fellow investors in order to maximize their own proportions of corporate earnings. This thrashing about, obviously fruitless in aggregate, has no impact on the equity coupon but reduces the investor’s portion of it, because he incurs substantial frictional costs, such as advisory fees and brokerage charges. Throw in an active options market, which adds nothing to the productivity of American enterprise but requires a cast of thousands to man the casino, and frictional costs rise further.

<br>

## 股票是永续的 Stocks are perpetual

它也是真的，在现实世界中，投资股票的人通常不能以账面价值买入。有时他们能够以低于账面价值的价格买入；但通常情况下，他们不得不支付高于账面价值的价格，而当这种情况发生时，对那12%的回报就有进一步的压力。我稍后会再谈这些关系。与此同时，让我们关注主要的一点：随着通货膨胀的增加，股本资本的回报并没有增加。从本质上讲，那些购买股票的人得到的证券具有与购买债券的人相同的固定回报。

It is also true that in the real world investors in stocks don’t usually get to buy at book value. Sometimes they have been able to buy in below book; usually, however, they’ve had to pay more than book, and when that happens there is further pressure on that 12%. I’ll talk more about these relationships later. Meanwhile, let’s focus on the main point: as inflation has increased, the return on equity capital has not. Essentially, those who buy equities receive securities with an underlying fixed return just like those who buy bonds.

<br>

当然，债券和股票之间有一些重要的区别。首先，债券最终会到期。这可能需要很长时间的等待，但最终债券投资者可以重新谈判他的合同条款。如果当前和预期的通货膨胀率使他的旧票息看起来不够，他可以拒绝继续参与，除非目前提供的票息能重新激发他的兴趣。近年来，这种情况一直在发生。

Of course, there are some important differences between the bond and stock forms. For openers, bonds eventually come due. It may require a long wait, but eventually the bond investor gets to renegotiate the terms of his contract. If current and prospective rates of inflation make his old coupon look inadequate, he can refuse to play further unless coupons currently being offered rekindle his interest. Something of this sort has been going on in recent years.

<br>

股票，另一方面，是永久性的。它们的到期日是无限的。股票投资者必须接受美国企业所赚取的回报。如果美国企业注定要赚取12%，那么这就是投资者必须学会接受的水平。作为一个整体，股票投资者既不能选择退出，也不能重新协商。总体而言，他们的承诺实际上是在增加的。个别公司可以出售或清算，公司也可以回购自己的股份；但总的来说，新的股权发行和留存收益保证了被锁定在企业系统中的股权资本会增加。所以，债券形式得了一分。债券息票最终会被重新协商；股权“息票”则不会。当然，很长一段时间以来，12%的息票似乎并不需要太多的修正。

Stocks, on the other hand, are perpetual. They have a maturity date of infinity. Investors in stocks are stuck with whatever return corporate America happens to earn. If corporate America is destined to earn 12%, then that is the level investors must learn to live with. As a group, stock investors can neither opt out nor renegotiate. In the aggregate, their commitment is actually increasing. Individual companies can be sold or liquidated and corporations can repurchase their own shares; on balance, however, new equity flotations and retained earnings guarantee that the equity capital locked up in the corporate system will increase. So, score one for the bond form. Bond coupons eventually will be renegotiated; equity “coupons” won’t. It is true, of course, that for a long time a 12% coupon did not appear in need of a whole lot of correction.

<br>

## 债券持有人可以获得现金 The bondholder gets it in cash

有一种普通债券和我们新的奇异的12%“股权债券”之间的另一个主要区别，这种股权债券穿着股票证书来到华尔街化妆舞会。在通常情况下，债券投资者以现金形式收到他的全部息票，并留给他自己尽力重新投资。相比之下，我们的股票投资者的股权息票部分被公司保留，并以公司正在赚取的任何利率进行再投资。换句话说，回到我们的公司宇宙，每年赚取的12%中的一部分以股息形式支付，余额则重新投入到宇宙中，也赚取12%。

There is another major difference between the garden variety of bond and our new exotic 12% “equity bond” that comes to the Wall Street costume ball dressed in a stock certificate. In the usual case, a bond investor receives his entire coupon in cash and is left to reinvest it as best he can. Our stock investor’s equity coupon, in contrast, is partially retained by the company and is reinvested at whatever rates the company happens to be earning. In other words, going back to our corporate universe, part of the 12% earned annually is paid out in dividends and the balance is put right back into the universe to earn 12% also.

<br>

## 过去的好日子 The good old days

股票的这种特点——部分利息的再投资——可能是好消息，也可能是坏消息，这取决于那12%的相对吸引力。在20世纪50年代和60年代初，这个消息非常好。当债券只有3%或4%的收益时，自动以12%的利率再投资部分股息的权利是非常有价值的。请注意，投资者不能只投资他们自己的钱，得到那12%的回报。在这个时期，股票价格远高于账面价值，投资者被他们必须支付的溢价所阻止，无法直接从底层的公司宇宙中提取出该宇宙所赚取的任何利率。你不能为一张12%的债券支付远高于面值的价格，并为自己赚取12%。

This characteristic of stocks — the reinvestment of part of the coupon — can be good or bad news, depending on the relative attractiveness of that 12%. The news was very good indeed in the 1950s and early 1960s. With bonds yielding only 3 or 4%, the right to reinvest automatically a portion of the equity coupon at 12% was of enormous value. Note that investors could not just invest their own money and get that 12% return. Stock prices in this period ranged far above book value, and investors were prevented by the premium prices they had to pay from directly extracting out of the underlying corporate universe whatever rate that universe was earning. You can’t pay far above par for a 12% bond and earn 12% for yourself.

<br>

但是在他们保留的收益上，投资者可以赚取12%的回报。实际上，留存收益使投资者能够以账面价值购买部分企业，而在当时存在的经济环境中，这部分企业的价值远远超过了账面价值。

But on their retained earnings, investors could earn 12%. In effect, earnings retention allowed investors to buy at book value part of an enterprise that, in the economic environment then existing, was worth a great deal more than book value.

<br>

这是一种让现金股息几乎没有优势，而留存收益却有很大好处的情况。事实上，投资者认为有可能以12%的利率再投资的钱越多，他们就越珍视他们的再投资权利，也就越愿意为此付出高价。在20世纪60年代初，投资者急切地为位于增长地区的电力公用事业公司支付高价，因为他们知道这些公司有能力再投资很大比例的收益。而那些经营环境要求更多现金分红的公用事业公司则获得较低的价格。

It was a situation that left very little to be said for cash dividends and a lot to be said for earnings retention. Indeed, the more money that investors thought likely to be reinvested at the 12% rate, the more valuable they considered their reinvestment privilege, and the more they were willing to pay for it. In the early 19601s, investors eagerly paid top-scale prices for electric utilities situated in growth areas, knowing that these companies had the ability to re-invest very large proportions of their earnings. Utilities whose operating environment dictated a larger cash payout rated lower prices.

<br>

如果在这段时间里，存在一种高级、不可赎回、长期的债券，其票面利率为12%，那么它的价格就会远高于面值。而如果它还有另一种不寻常的特征——即大部分的票息可以自动以面值的价格再投资于类似的债券——那么这种债券就会有更高的溢价。从本质上讲，保留大部分收益的成长股就代表了这样一种证券。当它们对新增股本的再投资率为12%，而一般的利率大约为4%时，投资者就会非常高兴——当然，他们也会付出高昂的价格。

If, during this period, a high-grade, noncallable, long-term bond with a 12% coupon had existed, it would have sold far above par. And if it were a bond with a further unusual characteristic — which was that most of the coupon payments could be automatically reinvested at par in similar bonds — the issue would have commanded an even greater premium. In essence, growth stocks retaining most of their earnings represented just such a security. When their reinvestment rate on the added equity capital was 12% while interest rates generally were around 4%, investors became very happy — and, of course, they paid happy prices.

<br>

## 寻找出口 Heading for the exits

回顾过去，股票投资者可以认为自己在1946-66年期间享受了一份真正丰厚的三重奖励。首先，他们受益于公司内在的股本回报率远高于当前的利率。其次，其中相当一部分回报被以其他方式无法达到的利率为他们再投资。第三，随着前两个好处被广泛认识到，他们得到了对内在股本资本的不断升值的评估。这第三重奖励意味着，除了公司以其股本资本赚取的基本12%左右的回报外，投资者还获得了一个额外的奖励，因为道琼斯工业指数从1946年的账面价值的133%上升到1966年的220%。这样一个标价过程暂时让投资者获得了超过他们所投资的企业内在盈利能力的回报。

Looking back, stock investors can think of themselves in the 1946-66 period as having been ladled a truly bountiful triple dip. First, they were the beneficiaries of an underlying corporate return on equity that was far above prevailing interest rates. Second, a significant portion of that return was reinvested for them at rates that were otherwise unattainable. And third, they were afforded an escalating appraisal of underlying equity capital as the first two benefits became widely recognized. This third dip meant that, on top of the basic 12% or so earned by corporations on their equity capital, investors were receiving a bonus as the Dow Jones industrials increased in price from 133% of book value in 1946 to 220% in 1966. Such a marking-up process temporarily allowed investors to achieve a return that exceeded the inherent earning power of the enterprises in which they had invested.

<br>

这种天堂般的情况终于在20世纪60年代中期被许多主要的投资机构“发现”。但正当这些金融大象开始互相踩踏，争相投资股票时，我们进入了一个加速通货膨胀和利率上升的时代。相当合理地，标价过程开始逆转。上升的利率无情地降低了所有现有固定票息投资的价值。而随着长期公司债券利率开始上升（最终达到10%左右），12%的股权回报和再投资“特权”就开始显得不同了。

This heaven-on-earth situation finally was “discovered” in the mid-1960s by many major investing institutions. But just as these financial elephants began trampling on one another in their rush to equities, we entered an era of accelerating inflation and higher interest rates. Quite logically, the marking-up process began to reverse itself. Rising interest rates ruthlessly reduced the value of all existing fixed-coupon investments. And as long-term corporate bond rates began moving up (eventually reaching the 10% area), both the equity return of 12% and the reinvestment “privilege” began to look different.
