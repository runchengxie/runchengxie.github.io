<br>

亲爱的伯克希尔哈撒韦股东们：

To the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:

<br>

我密切关注了伯克希尔哈撒韦在沃伦·巴菲特的领导下取得的50年非凡成功历程。现在，独立地补充一下他所发表的任何庆祝性评论似乎是合适的。我将尝试做五件事情：

I closely watched the 50-year history of Berkshire’s uncommon success under Warren Buffett. And it now seems appropriate that I independently supplement whatever celebratory comment comes from him. I will try to do five things.

<br>

1.描述导致一家小型、注定无法挽救的商品纺织企业，如何演变成如今强大的伯克希尔的管理体系和政策。

1.Describe the management system and policies that caused a small and unfixably-doomed commodity textile business to morph into the mighty Berkshire that now exists,

<br>

2.解释管理体系和政策的形成过程。

2.Explain how the management system and policies came into being,

<br>

3.在一定程度上解释伯克希尔为何表现出色。

3.Explain, to some extent, why Berkshire did so well,

<br>

4.预测如果巴菲特很快离开，是否会继续取得异常出色的业绩。

4.Predict whether abnormally good results would continue if Buffett were soon to depart, and

<br>

5.考虑伯克希尔在过去50年取得的非凡成就是否具有可能在其他地方有用的含义。

5.Consider whether Berkshire’s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may prove useful elsewhere.

<br>

伯克希尔在巴菲特（以下统称为“伯克希尔体系”）的管理体制和政策早已确定，如下所述：

The management system and policies of Berkshire under Buffett (herein together called “the Berkshire system”) were fixed early and are described below:

<br>

1.伯克希尔将成为一个分散的企业集团，只对无法做出有用预测的活动持避免态度。

1.Berkshire would be a diffuse conglomerate, averse only to activities about which it could not make useful predictions.

<br>

2.其顶级公司几乎所有业务都将通过独立的子公司进行，这些子公司的首席执行官将拥有极高的自主权。

2.Its top company would do almost all business through separately incorporated subsidiaries whose CEOs would operate with very extreme autonomy.

<br>

3.集团总部几乎没有其他人员，只有一个小小的办公套间，其中包括主席、首席财务官和几名主要协助首席财务官进行审计、内部控制等的助手。

3.There would be almost nothing at conglomerate headquarters except a tiny office suite containing a Chairman, a CFO, and a few assistants who mostly helped the CFO with auditing, internal control, etc.

<br>

4.伯克希尔的子公司将始终包括财产险公司。预计这些保险公司将作为一个群体，产生可靠的承保盈利，同时产生大量的“浮动资金”（来自未支付的保险赔款），用于投资。

4.Berkshire subsidiaries would always prominently include casualty insurers. Those insurers as a group would be expected to produce, in due course, dependable underwriting gains while also producing substantial “float” (from unpaid insurance liabilities) for investment.

<br>

5.由于子公司将拥有自己的系统，通常是不同的，所以不会有重要的系统范围的人事系统、股票期权系统、其他激励系统、退休制度等。

5.There would be no significant system-wide personnel system, stock option system, other incentive system, retirement system, or the like, because the subsidiaries would have their own systems, often different.

<br>

6.伯克希尔的主席将仅保留一些活动：

6.Berkshire’s Chairman would reserve only a few activities for himself.

<br>

i.他将管理几乎所有的证券投资，这些投资通常位于伯克希尔的财产险公司。

i.He would manage almost all security investments, with these normally residing in Berkshire’s casualty insurers.

<br>

ii.他将挑选所有重要子公司的首席执行官，并确定他们的薪酬，并从每位首席执行官那里获取在需要时能立即提供的继任者的私人推荐。

ii.He would choose all CEOs of important subsidiaries, and he would fix their compensation and obtain from each a private recommendation for a successor in case one was suddenly needed.

<br>

iii.他将在不需要的子公司增加竞争优势后，部署大部分现金，理想的部署是将这些现金用于收购新的子公司。

iii.He would deploy most cash not needed in subsidiaries after they had increased their competitive advantage, with the ideal deployment being the use of that cash to acquire new subsidiaries.

<br>

iv.他将迅速提供给任何子公司首席执行官希望的几乎所有联系，并且几乎不需要额外的联系。

iv.He would make himself promptly available for almost any contact wanted by any subsidiary’s CEO, and he would require almost no additional contact.

<br>

v.他将撰写一封长篇、逻辑且有用的信件，设计成如果他只是一名被动股东时希望它的样子，并将在年度股东大会上花费数小时回答问题。

v.He would write a long, logical, and useful letter for inclusion in his annual report, designed as he would wish it to be if he were only a passive shareholder, and he would be available for hours of answering questions at annual shareholders’ meetings.

<br>

vi.他将努力成为一种对顾客、股东和其他利益相关者都能长期运作良好的文化的楷模，不论在他离开前后都是如此。

vi.He would try to be an exemplar in a culture that would work well for customers, shareholders, and other incumbents for a long time, both before and after his departure.

<br>

vii.他的首要任务将是为安静的阅读和思考保留大量时间，特别是那些可能推动他的不断学习的时间，无论他年龄多大；

vii.His first priority would be reservation of much time for quiet reading and thinking, particularly that which might advance his determined learning, no matter how old he became; and

<br>

viii.并且他还将花费大量时间热情地欣赏其他人所取得的成就。

viii.He would also spend much time in enthusiastically admiring what others were accomplishing.
