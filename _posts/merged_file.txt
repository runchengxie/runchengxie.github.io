<br>

全面就业、繁荣时期的利润和创纪录的股息支付并不意味着股票价格低迷。过去五年，大多数行业都在这股繁荣浪潮中波澜不惊地前进。

Full employment, boomtime profits and record dividend payments do not set the stage for depressed security prices. Most industries have been riding this wave of prosperity during the past five years with few ripples to disturb the tide.

<br>

汽车保险业并没有分享这种繁荣。在战后立即出现的惨重损失之后，情况在1949年开始好转。1950年，股份制财产保险公司再次遭受重创，承保经验是15年来第二差的。财产保险公司，特别是那些以汽车险为主的公司，最近的盈利报告已经使牛市对它们的股票失去了热情。从正常的盈利能力和资产因素来看，这些股票中的许多似乎被低估了。这个行业的性质使其能够缓解周期性的波动。

The auto insurance business has not shared in the boom. After the staggering losses of the immediate postwar period, the situation began to right itself in 1949. In 1950, stock casualty companies again took it on the chin with underwriting experience the second worst in 15 years. The recent earnings reports of casualty companies, particularly those with the bulk of writings in auto lines, have diverted bull market enthusiasm from their stocks. On the basis of normal earning power and asset factors, many of these stocks appear undervalued. The nature of the industry is such as to ease cyclical bumps.

<br>

汽车保险被大多数购买者视为一种必需品。合同必须每年按照经验重新定价。在1945-1951年这样一个物价上涨的时期，费率落后于成本虽然有不利的影响，但如果通缩力量开始发挥作用，应该会有利。

Auto insurance is regarded as a necessity by the majority of purchasers. Contracts must be renewed yearly at rates based upon experience. The lag of rates behind costs, although detrimental in a period of rising prices as has characterized the 1945-1951 period, should prove beneficial if deflationary forces should be set in action.

<br>

其他行业的优势包括没有库存、收款、劳动力和原材料问题。产品过时和相关设备过时的风险也不存在。

Other industry advantages include lack of inventory, collection, labor and raw material problems. The hazard of product obsolescence and related equipment obsolescence is also absent.

<br>

政府雇员保险公司（Government Employees Insurance Corporation）是在20世纪30年代中期成立的，为符合条件的类别提供全国范围内的完整汽车保险，包括：（1）联邦、州和市政府雇员；（2）现役和预备役军官和军队中前三级别的士官；（3）在现役期间符合条件的退伍军人；（4）前保单持有人；（5）大学、学院和学校的教职员；（6）从事国防工作的政府承包商雇员，以及（7）股东。

Government Employees Insurance Corporation was organized in the mid-30’s to provide complete auto insurance on a nation wide basis to an eligible class including: (1) Federal, State and municipal government employees; (2) active and reserve commissioned officers and the first three pay grades of non-commissioned officers of the Armed Forces; (3) veterans who were eligible when on active duty; (4) former policyholders; (5) faculty members of universities, colleges and schools; (6) government contractor employees engaged in defense work exclusively, and (7) stockholders.

<br>

这家公司没有代理商或分支机构。因此，保单持有人可以以高达30%的折扣获得标准的汽车保险。公司通过全国约500名代表迅速处理索赔。

The company has no agents or branch offices. As a result, policyholders receive standard auto insurance policies at premium discounts running as high as 30% off manual rates. Claims are handled promptly through approximately 500 representatives throughout the country.

<br>

在过去的几年里，有些公司被滥用地称为“增长型公司”，而它们的销售增长只不过是价格的通货膨胀和商业竞争的普遍放松。GEICO是一家合格的增长型公司，其记录如下：

| Year | Premiums Written | Policyholders |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| 1936 | 103,696.31       | 3,754         |
| 1940 | 768,057.86       | 25,514        |
| 1945 | 1,638,562.09     | 51,697        |
| 1950 | 8,016,975.79     | 143,944       |


The term “growth company” has been applied with abandon during the past few years to companies whose sales increases represented little more than inflation of prices and general easing of business competition. GEICO qualifies as a legitimate growth company based upon the following record:

<br>

当然，今天的投资者并不能从昨天的增长中获利。在GEICO的案例中，有理由相信增长的主要部分还在未来。在1950年之前，该公司只在50个司法管辖区中的15个（包括华盛顿特区和夏威夷）获得了许可。在今年年初，纽约州还不到3,000名保单持有人。然而，在纽约省下125美元的保险费用的25%应该比在人口稀少地区省下50美元费用的25%对潜在客户更有吸引力。

Of course the investor of today does not profit from yesterday’s growth. In GEICO’s case, there is reason to believe the major portion of growth lies ahead. Prior to 1950, the company was only licensed in 15 of 50 jurisdictions including D. C. and Hawaii. At the beginning of the year there were less than 3,000 policyholders In New York State. Yet 25% saved on an insurance bill of $125 in New York should look bigger to the prospect than the 25% saved on the $50 rate in more sparsely settled regions.

<br>

在经济衰退时期，成本竞争的重要性增加，GEICO的费率优势应该更能有效地从亲戚手中抢走业务。由于通货膨胀，保险费率上升，费率之间的25%差距在美元和分的意义上变得更大。

As cost competition increases in importance during times of recession, GEICO’s rate attraction should become even more effective in diverting business from the brother-in-law. With insurance rates moving higher due to inflation, the 25% spread in rates becomes wider in terms of dollars and cents.

<br>

我们的代理人不会有压力去接受有问题的申请人或续签风险较高的客户。在费率结构不合理的州，新的推广可能会停止。

There is no pressure from agents to accept questionable applicants or renew poor risks. In States where the rate structure is inadequate, new promotion may be halted.

<br>

GEICO最大的吸引力可能是它享有的利润率优势。1949年，GEICO的承保利润与已赚保费的比率为27.5%，而贝斯特(Best's)总结的135家股份制财产和担保公司的比率为6.7%。随着1950年经验的恶化，贝斯特(Best's)集团的利润率下降到3.0%，而GEICO的利润率下降到18.0%。GEICO并不经营所有的财产险业务；然而，人身伤害和财产损失，这两个对GEICO来说很重要的业务线，也是利润最低的业务线之一。

Probably the biggest attraction of GEICO is the profit margin advantage it enjoys. The ratio of underwriting profit to premiums earned in 1949 was 27.5% for GEICO as compared to 6.7% for the 135 stock casualty and surety companies summarized by Best’s. As experience turned for the worse in 1950, Best’s aggregate’s profit margin dropped to 3.0% and GEICO’s dropped to 18.0%. GEICO does not write all casualty lines; however, bodily Injury and property damage, both important lines for GEICO, were among the least profitable lines.

<br>

GEICO还从事大量的碰撞险业务，这是1950年的一项有利可图的业务。在1951年上半年，几乎所有的保险公司在人身伤害和财产损失等最不赚钱的责任险方面都是亏损的。

GEICO also does a large amount of collision writing, which was a profitable line In 1950. During the first half of 1951, practically all insurers operated in the red on casualty lines with bodily injury and property damage among the most unprofitable.

<br>

GEICO的利润率被削减到略高于9%，而马萨诸塞州保险公司却亏损了16%，新阿姆斯特丹保险公司亏损了8%，标准事故保险公司亏损了9%，等等。

Whereas GEICO’s profit margin was cut to slightly above 9%, Massachusett’s Bonding & Insurance showed a 16% loss, New Amsterdam Casualty an 8% loss, Standard Accident Insurance a 9% loss, etc.

<br>

由于GEICO的快速增长，现金股利不得不保持低水平。股票股利和25比1的拆分使得在1948年6月1日至1951年11月10日期间，流通股数从3,000股增加到250,000股。还发行了有价值的权利，订阅附属公司的股票。

Because of the rapid growth of GEICO, cash dividends have had to remain low. Stock dividends and a 25-for-1 split increased the outstanding shares from 3,000 on June 1, 1948, to 250,000 on Nov. 10, 1951. Valuable rights to sub scribe to stock of affiliated companies have also been Issued.

<br>

本杰明·格雷厄姆自从他的投资信托在1948年收购并分发了一大块股票后，就一直担任董事会主席。自从创立以来，就一直指导GEICO的增长的能干总裁是李奥·古德温。

Benjamin Graham has been Chairman of the Board since his investment trust acquired and distributed a large block of the stock in 1948. Leo Goodwin, who has guided GEICO’s growth since inception, is the able President.

<br>

1950年底，董事会的10名成员拥有大约三分之一的股份。

At the end of 1950. the 10 members of the Board of Directors owned approximately one – third of the outstanding stock.

<br>

1950年的收益为3.92美元，与1949年较少的业务收入的4.71美元形成了对比。这些数字没有考虑到未赚取保费准备金的增加，这在两年中都很可观。

Earnings in 1950 amounted to $3.92 as contrasted to $4.71 on the smaller amount of business in 1949. These figures include no allowance for the increase in the unearned premium reserve which was substantial in both years.

<br>

1951年的收益将低于1950年，但去年夏天的一波利率上涨应该会在1952年的收益中体现出来。投资收入在1947年到1950年间增加了四倍，反映了公司资产的增长。

Earnings in 1951 will be lower than 1950, but the wave of rate increases during the past summer should evidence themselves in 1952 earnings. Investment income quadrupled between 1947 and 1950, reflecting the growth of the company’s assets.

<br>

按照目前大约是1950年行业糟糕年份收益的八倍的价格来看，似乎没有人为这家公司巨大的增长潜力付出任何代价。

At the present price of about eight times the earnings of 1950, a poor year for the industry, it appears that no price is being paid for the tremendous growth potential of the company.

<br>

我最喜欢的证券是一家年轻、快速增长且管理能力强的保险公司的股票。虽然政府雇员保险公司，我15个月前的选择，其股价已经上涨了100%以上，但它仍然是一个非常有吸引力的长期资本增长的载体。

Again my favorite security is the equity stock of a young, rapidly growing and ably managed insurance company. Although Government Employees Insurance Co., my selection of 15 months ago, has had a price rise of more than 100%, it still appears very attractive as a vehicle for long-term capital growth.

<br>

很少有投资者能够以西方保险证券公司（Western Insurance Securities Company）目前极低的估值参与到两家优秀的、不断扩张的保险公司的增长中。这两家运营子公司，西方责任与担保（Western Casualty & Surety）和西方火灾（Western Fire），在1952年以2,959万美元的净资产规模，实现了2,600万美元的保费收入。目前在38个州获得了许可，它们令人印象深刻的增长记录，无论是绝对值还是相对于行业，都在下面的表格I中总结出来。

Rarely is an investor offered the opportunity to participate in the growth of two excellently managed and expanding insurance companies on the grossly undervalued basis which appears possible in the case of the Western Insurance Securities Company. The two operating subsidiaries, Western Casualty & Surety and Western Fire, wrote a premium volume of $26,009,929 in 1952 on consolidated admitted assets of S29,590,142. Now licensed in 38 states, their impressive growth record, both absolutely and relative to the industry, is summarized in Table I below.

<br>

西方保险证券公司拥有西方伤害和保证公司的92%，而西方伤害和保证公司又拥有西方火灾保险公司的99.95%。西方保险证券公司的其他资产微不足道，大约有18万美元的净流动资产。其资本结构包括7000股100美元面值6%的优先股，可赎回价为125美元；35000股A类优先股，可赎回价为60美元，每股享有2.50美元的定期股息，并进一步参与到每股最高4美元的股息中；以及50000股普通股。A类优先股目前的欠发金额为36.75美元。

Western Insurance Securities owns 92% of Western Casualty and Surety, which in turn owns 99.95% of Western Fire Insurance. Other assets of Western Insurance Securities are minor, consisting of approximately $180,000 in net quick assets. The capitalization consists of 7,000 shares of $100 par 6% preferred, callable at $125; 35,000 shares of Class A preferred, callable at $60, which is entitled to a $2.50 regular dividend and participates further up to a maximum total of $4 per share; and 50,000 shares of common stock. The arrears on the Class A presently amount to $36.75.

<br>

由雷·杜博克领导的管理层是最高级别的。杜博克先生自1924年公司成立以来一直出色地引领着公司，并在保险行业享有杰出的诚信和能力的声誉。第二层次的高管也是顶尖水平的。在公司形成期，高级管理费用与企业的盈利能力不相称。读者可以清楚地看出，当保费收入在300万美元左右时，同样的高级管理费用会造成多大的困难，而当保费收入超过2600万美元时，这些费用就不会造成多大的麻烦了。

The management headed by Ray DuBoc is of the highest grade. Mr. DuBoc has ably steered the company since its inception in 1924 and has a reputation in the insurance industry of being a man of outstanding integrity and ability. The second tier of executives is also of top caliber. During the formative years of the company, senior charges were out of line with the earning power of the enterprise. The reader can clearly perceive why the same senior charges that caused such great difficulty when premium volume ranged about the $3,000,000 mark would cause little trouble upon the attainment of premium volume in excess of $26,000,000.

<br>

1952年，这家公司赚了1367063美元，这是汽车保险业非常低迷的一年。这足以覆盖总高级费用129500美元的十倍以上。普通股每股收益为24.74美元。这是在仅调整了未赚保费准备金增加的25%之后的数字。

The company earned $1,367,063 in 1952, a very depressed year for auto insurers. This was enough to cover the total senior charges of $129,500 more than 10 times over. The earnings per share of common stock were $24.74. This was after adjusting for only 25% of the increase in the unearned premium reserve.

<br>

很明显，普通股已经成为了主流，尽管投资者似乎没有意识到这一点，因为这只股票的市盈率不到2倍，而且比1952年12月31日的每股账面价值86.26美元低了大约55%。表二显示了战后的盈利记录，并生动地说明了普通股因为扩大的盈利基础而获得的好处。账面价值是在允许对未赚保费准备金25%的权益，并在允许优先股赎回价加上拖欠利息后计算的。

It is quite evident that the common stock has finally arrived, although investors do not appear to realize it since the stock is quoted at less than twice earnings and at a discount of approximately 55% from the December 31, 1952 book value of $86.26 per share. Table II indicates the postwar record of earnings and dramatically illustrates the benefits being realized by the common stock because of the expanded earnings base. The book value is calculated with allowance for a 25% equity in the unearned premium reserve and is after allowance for call price plus arrears on the preferreds.

<br>

西方公司在提高其保费市场份额方面取得了优异的业绩，而没有降低其标准。事实上，在过去的十年里，西方公司的运营比率远远优于平均多元化公司。表三将两家西方公司的综合损失和费用比率与所有股份制火灾和意外保险公司的类似比率进行了比较，这些比率是按照阿尔弗雷德·M·贝斯特公司的案例基础报告的。

Western has achieved an excellent record in increasing its industry share of premium volume, without compromising its standards. In fact, during the past ten years, Western’s operating ratios have been quite superior to the average multiple line company. Table III compares the combined loss and expense ratios for the two Western companies as reported by the Alfred M. Best Co. on a case basis with similar ratios for all stock fire and casualty companies.

<br>

仔细的读者不会忽略这样一种可能性，即西方公司的优异表现是由于它在特别有利的领域集中投资。实际上情况恰恰相反。虽然涉及所有主要领域，但西方公司仍然主要是一家汽车保险公司，其60%的业务量来自汽车领域。由于汽车承保在战后时期总体上是不满意的，特别是在过去三年里，西方公司的经验相对于行业而言更为有利，而不仅仅是表格比较所能显示的那样。

The careful reader will not overlook the possibility that Western’s superior performance has been due to a concentration of writings in unusually profitable lines. Actually the reverse is true. Although represented in all major lines, Western is still primarily an automobile insurer with 60% of its volume derived from auto lines. Since automobile underwriting has proven generally unsatisfactory in the postwar period, and particularly so in the last three years, Western’s experience was even more favorable relative to the industry than the tabular comparison would indicate.

<br>

西方公司在未解决的索赔上一直保持了充足的损失准备金。战后时期的承保结果显示，西方公司在每年年底都有过剩的准备金。保险监管机构每三年进行的审查也证实了这些发现。

Western has always maintained ample loss reserves on unsettled claims. Underwriting results in the postwar period have shown Western to be overreserved at the end of each year. Triennial examinations conducted by the insurance commissioners have confirmed these findings.

<br>

他们的投资情况，我们当然会发现投资资产和投资收入与保费收入的增长相平行。西方保险公司的合并净资产从1940年的5,154,367美元增长到目前的29,590,142美元。西方保险公司遵循极其保守的投资政策，依靠保费收入的增长来扩大投资收入。截至年底的21,889,243美元的投资组合中，政府债券加上一系列多样化的高质量市政债券总计20,141,246美元，占92%，而股票只有1,747,997美元，占8%。1952年的净投资收入为474,472美元，相当于西方保险公司普通股每股6.14美元，扣除少数股东权益并假设高级费用完全由投资收入支付。

Turning to their investment picture, we of course find a growth in invested assets and investment income paralleling the growth in premium volume. Consolidated net assets have risen from $5,154,367 in 1940 to their present level of $29,590,142. Western follows an extremely conservative investment policy, relying upon growth in premium volume for expansion in investment income. Of the year-end portfolio of $21,889,243, governments plus a list of well diversified high quality municipals total $20,141,246 or 92% and stocks only $1,747,997 or 8%. Net investment income of $474,472 in 1952 was equal to $6.14 per share of Western Insurance common after minority interest and assuming senior charges were covered entirely from investment income.

<br>

在过去的几年里，财产保险行业在汽车保险业务上遭受了惨重的损失。这一趋势在1952年末得到了明显的逆转。1951年和1952年的大幅费率提高正在对承保结果产生越来越大的影响，因为保单以更高的保费续签。预计1953年和1954年，财产保险行业的盈利将达到非常满意的水平。

The casualty insurance industry has suffered staggering losses on automobile insurance lines during the past several years. This trend was sharply reversed during late 1952. Substantial rate increases in 1951 and 1952 are being brought to bear on underwriting results with increasing force as policies are renewed at much higher premiums. Earnings within the casualty industry are expected to be on a very satisfactory basis in 1953 and 1954.

<br>

西方公司在整个艰难时期都非常盈利，预计随着保费收入的增加、资产的增加和费率结构的提高，其收益将有所增加。到1954年，可以保守地预计其保费收入将达到3,000万美元。这一收入的正常盈利能力应该平均每股约30.00美元，其中投资收入在扣除所有投资收入的高级费用后约为每股8.40美元。

Western, while operating very profitably during the entire trying period, may be expected to report increased earnings as a result of expanding premium volume, increased assets, and the higher rate structure. An earned premium volume of $30,000,000 may be conservatively expected by 1954. Normal earning power on this volume should average about $30.00 per share, with investment income contributing approximately $8.40 per share after deducting all senior charges from investment income.

<br>

西方保险公司的普通股投资者可以合理地确信，他们的股权地位得到了极大的加强。值得记住的是，过去12年里，这些运营公司的保费收入增长了550%。这就要求增加350%的盈余，从而限制了股息的支付。西方伤害保险公司最近增加了股息，为更及时地支付拖欠款铺平了道路。任何保费收入的平稳将允许更宽松的股息，而过去增长率的延续，在我看来是非常不可能的，当然会带来更大的收益。

The patient investor in Western Insurance common can be reasonably assured of a tangible acknowledgment of his enormously strengthened equity position. It is well to bear in mind that the operating companies have expanded premium volume some 550% in the last 12 years. This has required an increase in surplus of 350% and consequently restricted the payment of dividends. Recent dividend increases by Western Casualty should pave the way for more prompt payment on arrearages. Any leveling off of premium volume will permit more liberal dividends while a continuation of the past rate of increase, which in my opinion is very unlikely, would of course make for much greater earnings.

<br>

Western Insurance common是目前价格约为40美元的一个很好的投资机会。该公司在一个稳定的行业中运营，有着增长和盈利的历史。该股票在场外交易，有着显著的资本增值潜力。

Western Insurance common is a great investment opportunity at its current price of around 40. The company operates in a stable industry and has a history of growth and profitability. The stock is traded over-the-counter and has the potential for significant capital appreciation.

<p class="small">原文标题：How inflation swindles the equity investor</p>

https://fortune.com/2011/06/12/buffett-how-inflation-swindles-the-equity-investor-fortune-classics-1977/

*编者注：每周日，财富杂志都会从我们的档案中发布一篇最喜欢的故事。随着争议围绕着美联储主席本·伯南克是否低估了通货膨胀预期，我们回顾了1977年5月的及时建议，来自沃伦·巴菲特。奥马哈先知与伯南克在通货膨胀问题上一次又一次地发生冲突，这里巴菲特警告说，上涨的价格会阻碍经济增长“不是因为市场下跌，而是尽管市场上涨。”*

*Editor’s Note: Every Sunday, Fortune publishes a favorite story from our archive. As controversy swirls around whether Fed Chair Ben Bernanke is downplaying inflation predictions, we turn back to May 1977 for timely advice from Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha has clashed with Bernanke over inflation time and time again, and here Buffett warns how rising prices can hamper growth “not because the market falls, but in spite of the fact that the market rises.”*

<br>

众所周知，股票和债券在通货膨胀的环境中表现不佳。过去十年的大部分时间，我们就处在这样的环境中，这对股市来说确实是一段困难的时期。但是，股市在这段时期遇到的问题的原因仍然不太清楚。

It is no longer a secret that stocks, like bonds, do poorly in an inflationary environment. We have been in such an environment for most of the past decade, and it has indeed been a time of troubles for stocks. But the reasons for the stock market’s problems in this period are still imperfectly understood.

<br>

在通货膨胀时代，债券持有者的问题并不神秘。当美元的价值每个月都在下降时，一种以这些美元为收入和本金支付的证券不会是一个大赢家。你几乎不需要一个经济学博士来弄清楚这一点。

There is no mystery at all about the problems of bondholders in an era of inflation. When the value of the dollar deteriorates month after month, a security with income and principal payments denominated in those dollars isn’t going to be a big winner. You hardly need a Ph.D. in economics to figure that one out.

<br>

为什么事情没有按照这样的方式发展呢？我认为主要原因是，从经济实质上看，股票和债券非常相似。

And why didn’t it turn out that way? The main reason, I believe, is that stocks, in economic substance, are really very similar to bonds.

<br>

我知道这种信念对许多投资者来说会显得古怪。他们会立刻指出，债券的回报（票息）是固定的，而股权投资的回报（公司的盈利）则可能从一年到另一年有很大的变化。这是事实。但是任何一个研究过战后公司总体回报的人都会发现一个非凡的事实：实际上，股本回报并没有太大的变化。

I know that this belief will seem eccentric to many investors. They will immediately observe that the return on a bond (the coupon) is fixed, while the return on an equity investment (the company’s earnings) can vary substantially from one year to another. True enough. But anyone who examines the aggregate returns that have been earned by companies during the postwar years will discover something extraordinary: the returns on equity have in fact not varied much at all.

<br>

## 息票是有粘性的 The coupon is sticky

战后的前10年——即截至1955年的十年间——道琼斯工业指数的年末股权平均年回报率为12.8%。第二个十年，这个数字是10.1%。第三个十年，它是10.9%。一个更大的样本，财富500强（其历史只能追溯到20世纪50年代中期），显示了类似的结果：截至1965年的十年间，回报率为11.2%，截至1975年的十年间，回报率为11.8%。少数几年的数据要高得多（500强的最高值是1974年的14.1%）或低得多（1958年和1970年是9.5%），但多年来，在总体上，账面价值的回报率往往会回归到12%左右的水平。无论是在通货膨胀的年份（或者说在物价稳定的年份），这一水平都没有明显超过。 

In the first 10 years after the war — the decade ending in 1955 — the Dow Jones industrials had an average annual return on year-end equity of 12.8%. In the second decade, the figure was 10.1%. In the third decade it was 10.9%. Data for a larger universe, the Fortune 500 (whose history goes back only to the mid-1950s), indicate somewhat similar results: 11.2% in the decade ending in 1965, 11.8% in the decade through 1975. The figures for a few exceptional years have been substantially higher (the high for the 500 was 14.1% in 1974) or lower (9.5% in 1958 and 1970), but over the years, and in the aggregate, the return in book value tends to keep coming back to a level around 12%. It shows no signs of exceeding that level significantly in inflationary years (or in years of stable prices, for that matter).

<br>

我们暂时把这些公司，不是当作上市股票，而是当作生产企业。我们也假设这些企业的所有者是以账面价值购买的。在这种情况下，他们自己的回报率也会在12%左右。而且由于回报率非常稳定，把它看作是一个“股权票息”似乎是合理的。

For the moment, let’s think of those companies, not as listed stocks, but as productive enterprises. Let’s also assume that the owners of those enterprises had acquired them at book value. In that case, their own return would have been around 12% too. And because the return has been so consistent, it seems reasonable to think of it as an “equity coupon.”

<br>

在现实世界中，当然，投资股票的人不只是买了就不管。相反，许多人试图智胜同行，以便最大化自己的企业收益份额。这种无效的折腾，对股息券没有任何影响，但却降低了投资者的收益份额，因为他们承担了相当大的摩擦成本，如咨询费和经纪费。再加上一个活跃的期权市场，它对美国企业的生产力没有任何贡献，但却需要数千人来经营赌场，摩擦成本就更高了。

In the real world, of course, investors in stocks don’t just buy and hold. Instead, many try to outwit their fellow investors in order to maximize their own proportions of corporate earnings. This thrashing about, obviously fruitless in aggregate, has no impact on the equity coupon but reduces the investor’s portion of it, because he incurs substantial frictional costs, such as advisory fees and brokerage charges. Throw in an active options market, which adds nothing to the productivity of American enterprise but requires a cast of thousands to man the casino, and frictional costs rise further.

<br>

## 股票是永续的 Stocks are perpetual

它也是真的，在现实世界中，投资股票的人通常不能以账面价值买入。有时他们能够以低于账面价值的价格买入；但通常情况下，他们不得不支付高于账面价值的价格，而当这种情况发生时，对那12%的回报就有进一步的压力。我稍后会再谈这些关系。与此同时，让我们关注主要的一点：随着通货膨胀的增加，股本资本的回报并没有增加。从本质上讲，那些购买股票的人得到的证券具有与购买债券的人相同的固定回报。

It is also true that in the real world investors in stocks don’t usually get to buy at book value. Sometimes they have been able to buy in below book; usually, however, they’ve had to pay more than book, and when that happens there is further pressure on that 12%. I’ll talk more about these relationships later. Meanwhile, let’s focus on the main point: as inflation has increased, the return on equity capital has not. Essentially, those who buy equities receive securities with an underlying fixed return just like those who buy bonds.

<br>

当然，债券和股票之间有一些重要的区别。首先，债券最终会到期。这可能需要很长时间的等待，但最终债券投资者可以重新谈判他的合同条款。如果当前和预期的通货膨胀率使他的旧票息看起来不够，他可以拒绝继续参与，除非目前提供的票息能重新激发他的兴趣。近年来，这种情况一直在发生。

Of course, there are some important differences between the bond and stock forms. For openers, bonds eventually come due. It may require a long wait, but eventually the bond investor gets to renegotiate the terms of his contract. If current and prospective rates of inflation make his old coupon look inadequate, he can refuse to play further unless coupons currently being offered rekindle his interest. Something of this sort has been going on in recent years.

<br>

股票，另一方面，是永久性的。它们的到期日是无限的。股票投资者必须接受美国企业所赚取的回报。如果美国企业注定要赚取12%，那么这就是投资者必须学会接受的水平。作为一个整体，股票投资者既不能选择退出，也不能重新协商。总体而言，他们的承诺实际上是在增加的。个别公司可以出售或清算，公司也可以回购自己的股份；但总的来说，新的股权发行和留存收益保证了被锁定在企业系统中的股权资本会增加。所以，债券形式得了一分。债券息票最终会被重新协商；股权“息票”则不会。当然，很长一段时间以来，12%的息票似乎并不需要太多的修正。

Stocks, on the other hand, are perpetual. They have a maturity date of infinity. Investors in stocks are stuck with whatever return corporate America happens to earn. If corporate America is destined to earn 12%, then that is the level investors must learn to live with. As a group, stock investors can neither opt out nor renegotiate. In the aggregate, their commitment is actually increasing. Individual companies can be sold or liquidated and corporations can repurchase their own shares; on balance, however, new equity flotations and retained earnings guarantee that the equity capital locked up in the corporate system will increase. So, score one for the bond form. Bond coupons eventually will be renegotiated; equity “coupons” won’t. It is true, of course, that for a long time a 12% coupon did not appear in need of a whole lot of correction.

<br>

## 债券持有人可以获得现金 The bondholder gets it in cash

有一种普通债券和我们新的奇异的12%“股权债券”之间的另一个主要区别，这种股权债券穿着股票证书来到华尔街化妆舞会。在通常情况下，债券投资者以现金形式收到他的全部息票，并留给他自己尽力重新投资。相比之下，我们的股票投资者的股权息票部分被公司保留，并以公司正在赚取的任何利率进行再投资。换句话说，回到我们的公司宇宙，每年赚取的12%中的一部分以股息形式支付，余额则重新投入到宇宙中，也赚取12%。

There is another major difference between the garden variety of bond and our new exotic 12% “equity bond” that comes to the Wall Street costume ball dressed in a stock certificate. In the usual case, a bond investor receives his entire coupon in cash and is left to reinvest it as best he can. Our stock investor’s equity coupon, in contrast, is partially retained by the company and is reinvested at whatever rates the company happens to be earning. In other words, going back to our corporate universe, part of the 12% earned annually is paid out in dividends and the balance is put right back into the universe to earn 12% also.

<br>

## 过去的好日子 The good old days

股票的这种特点——部分利息的再投资——可能是好消息，也可能是坏消息，这取决于那12%的相对吸引力。在20世纪50年代和60年代初，这个消息非常好。当债券只有3%或4%的收益时，自动以12%的利率再投资部分股息的权利是非常有价值的。请注意，投资者不能只投资他们自己的钱，得到那12%的回报。在这个时期，股票价格远高于账面价值，投资者被他们必须支付的溢价所阻止，无法直接从底层的公司宇宙中提取出该宇宙所赚取的任何利率。你不能为一张12%的债券支付远高于面值的价格，并为自己赚取12%。

This characteristic of stocks — the reinvestment of part of the coupon — can be good or bad news, depending on the relative attractiveness of that 12%. The news was very good indeed in the 1950s and early 1960s. With bonds yielding only 3 or 4%, the right to reinvest automatically a portion of the equity coupon at 12% was of enormous value. Note that investors could not just invest their own money and get that 12% return. Stock prices in this period ranged far above book value, and investors were prevented by the premium prices they had to pay from directly extracting out of the underlying corporate universe whatever rate that universe was earning. You can’t pay far above par for a 12% bond and earn 12% for yourself.

<br>

但是在他们保留的收益上，投资者可以赚取12%的回报。实际上，留存收益使投资者能够以账面价值购买部分企业，而在当时存在的经济环境中，这部分企业的价值远远超过了账面价值。

But on their retained earnings, investors could earn 12%. In effect, earnings retention allowed investors to buy at book value part of an enterprise that, in the economic environment then existing, was worth a great deal more than book value.

<br>

这是一种让现金股息几乎没有优势，而留存收益却有很大好处的情况。事实上，投资者认为有可能以12%的利率再投资的钱越多，他们就越珍视他们的再投资权利，也就越愿意为此付出高价。在20世纪60年代初，投资者急切地为位于增长地区的电力公用事业公司支付高价，因为他们知道这些公司有能力再投资很大比例的收益。而那些经营环境要求更多现金分红的公用事业公司则获得较低的价格。

It was a situation that left very little to be said for cash dividends and a lot to be said for earnings retention. Indeed, the more money that investors thought likely to be reinvested at the 12% rate, the more valuable they considered their reinvestment privilege, and the more they were willing to pay for it. In the early 19601s, investors eagerly paid top-scale prices for electric utilities situated in growth areas, knowing that these companies had the ability to re-invest very large proportions of their earnings. Utilities whose operating environment dictated a larger cash payout rated lower prices.

<br>

如果在这段时间里，存在一种高级、不可赎回、长期的债券，其票面利率为12%，那么它的价格就会远高于面值。而如果它还有另一种不寻常的特征——即大部分的票息可以自动以面值的价格再投资于类似的债券——那么这种债券就会有更高的溢价。从本质上讲，保留大部分收益的成长股就代表了这样一种证券。当它们对新增股本的再投资率为12%，而一般的利率大约为4%时，投资者就会非常高兴——当然，他们也会付出高昂的价格。

If, during this period, a high-grade, noncallable, long-term bond with a 12% coupon had existed, it would have sold far above par. And if it were a bond with a further unusual characteristic — which was that most of the coupon payments could be automatically reinvested at par in similar bonds — the issue would have commanded an even greater premium. In essence, growth stocks retaining most of their earnings represented just such a security. When their reinvestment rate on the added equity capital was 12% while interest rates generally were around 4%, investors became very happy — and, of course, they paid happy prices.

<br>

## 寻找出口 Heading for the exits

回顾过去，股票投资者可以认为自己在1946-66年期间享受了一份真正丰厚的三重奖励。首先，他们受益于公司内在的股本回报率远高于当前的利率。其次，其中相当一部分回报被以其他方式无法达到的利率为他们再投资。第三，随着前两个好处被广泛认识到，他们得到了对内在股本资本的不断升值的评估。这第三重奖励意味着，除了公司以其股本资本赚取的基本12%左右的回报外，投资者还获得了一个额外的奖励，因为道琼斯工业指数从1946年的账面价值的133%上升到1966年的220%。这样一个标价过程暂时让投资者获得了超过他们所投资的企业内在盈利能力的回报。

Looking back, stock investors can think of themselves in the 1946-66 period as having been ladled a truly bountiful triple dip. First, they were the beneficiaries of an underlying corporate return on equity that was far above prevailing interest rates. Second, a significant portion of that return was reinvested for them at rates that were otherwise unattainable. And third, they were afforded an escalating appraisal of underlying equity capital as the first two benefits became widely recognized. This third dip meant that, on top of the basic 12% or so earned by corporations on their equity capital, investors were receiving a bonus as the Dow Jones industrials increased in price from 133% of book value in 1946 to 220% in 1966. Such a marking-up process temporarily allowed investors to achieve a return that exceeded the inherent earning power of the enterprises in which they had invested.

<br>

这种天堂般的情况终于在20世纪60年代中期被许多主要的投资机构“发现”。但正当这些金融大象开始互相踩踏，争相投资股票时，我们进入了一个加速通货膨胀和利率上升的时代。相当合理地，标价过程开始逆转。上升的利率无情地降低了所有现有固定票息投资的价值。而随着长期公司债券利率开始上升（最终达到10%左右），12%的股权回报和再投资“特权”就开始显得不同了。

This heaven-on-earth situation finally was “discovered” in the mid-1960s by many major investing institutions. But just as these financial elephants began trampling on one another in their rush to equities, we entered an era of accelerating inflation and higher interest rates. Quite logically, the marking-up process began to reverse itself. Rising interest rates ruthlessly reduced the value of all existing fixed-coupon investments. And as long-term corporate bond rates began moving up (eventually reaching the 10% area), both the equity return of 12% and the reinvestment “privilege” began to look different.

<br>

股票被认为比债券风险更高。虽然股票的收益在一定时间内基本固定，但它每年会有些波动。投资者对未来的态度可能会受到这些年度变化的很大影响，尽管这些变化往往是错误的。股票也更有风险，因为它们具有无限的到期期限。（即使是你友好的经纪人，如果他有任何可用的债券，也不会有胆量把一张100年期的债券当作“安全”的东西来兜售。）由于风险增加了，投资者的自然反应是期望股票的回报率高于债券的回报率——而12%的股票回报率相对于同一企业领域发行的债券的10%的回报率似乎并不令人满意。随着利差缩小，股票投资者开始寻找出路。

Stocks are quite properly thought of as riskier than bonds. While that equity coupon is more or less fixed over periods of time, it does fluctuate somewhat from year to year. Investors’ attitudes about the future can be affected substantially, although frequently erroneously, by those yearly changes. Stocks are also riskier because they come equipped with infinite maturities. (Even your friendly broker wouldn’t have the nerve to peddle a 100-year bond, if he had any available, as “safe.”) Because of the additional risk, the natural reaction of investors is to expect an equity return that is comfortably above the bond return — and 12% on equity versus, say, 10% on bonds issued by the same corporate universe does not seem to qualify as comfortable. As the spread narrows, equity investors start looking for the exits.

<br>

但是，当然，他们作为一个群体是无法退出的。他们所能做到的只是大量的转换，造成相当大的摩擦成本，以及一个新的、更低的估值水平，反映了在通货膨胀条件下12%的股权票息的降低吸引力。债券投资者在过去十年中经历了一连串的震惊，在发现任何给定票息水平都没有魔力的过程中：无论是6%、8%还是10%，债券仍然可能暴跌。股票投资者，他们通常不知道他们也有一个“票息”，仍然在接受这一点的教育。

But, of course, as a group they can’t get out. All they can achieve is a lot of movement, substantial frictional costs, and a new, much lower level of valuation, reflecting the lessened attractiveness of the 12% equity coupon under inflationary conditions. Bond investors have had a succession of shocks over the past decade in the course of discovering that there is no magic attached to any given coupon level: at 6%, or 8%, or 10%, bonds can still collapse in price. Stock investors, who are in general not aware that they too have a “coupon,” are still receiving their education on this point.

<br>

## 提高收益的五种方法 Five ways to improve earnings

我们真的必须把12%的股本息率视为不变吗？有没有什么法律规定，企业对股本资本的回报率不能根据永久性的平均通货膨胀率而向上调整？当然没有这样的法律。另一方面，美国企业不能凭愿望或命令来增加收益。要提高股本回报率，企业至少需要以下一项：（1）提高周转率，即销售额与业务中使用的总资产之间的比率；（2）更便宜的杠杆；（3）更多的杠杆；（4）更低的所得税；（5）更宽的销售毛利率。

Must we really view that 12% equity coupon as immutable? Is there any law that says the corporate return on equity capital cannot adjust itself upward in response to a permanently higher average rate of inflation? There is no such law, of course. On the other hand, corporate America cannot increase earnings by desire or decree. To raise that return on equity, corporations would need at least one of the following: (1) an increase in turnover, i.e., in the ratio between sales and total assets employed in the business; (2) cheaper leverage; (3) more leverage; (4) lower income taxes; (5) wider operating margins on sales.

<br>

就这些了。增加普通股的回报率就没有其他方法了。让我们看看能用这些方法做些什么。

And that’s it. There simply are no other ways to increase returns on common equity. Let’s see what can be done with these.

<br>

我们从周转率开始。在这个练习中，我们要考虑的三大类资产是应收账款、存货和固定资产，如厂房和机器。

We’ll begin with turnover. The three major categories of assets we have to think about for this exercise are accounts receivable, inventories, and fixed assets such as plants and machinery.

<br>

销售额增加时，应收账款也会按比例增加，无论销售额的增加是由更多的实物量还是由通货膨胀造成的。这里没有改进的空间。

Accounts receivable go up proportionally as sales go up, whether the increase in dollar sales is produced by more physical volume or by inflation. No room for improvement here.

<br>

存货的情况就不那么简单了。从长期来看，单位存货的趋势可以预期会跟随单位销售的趋势。但是，从短期来看，物理周转率可能会因为一些特殊因素而波动——例如，成本预期或瓶颈。

With inventories, the situation is not quite so simple. Over the long term, the trend in unit inventories may be expected to follow the trend in unit sales. Over the short term, however, the physical turnover rate may bob around because of special influences — e.g., cost expectations, or bottlenecks.


<br>

使用后进先出（LIFO）存货计价方法可以在通货膨胀时期提高报告的周转率。当美元销售额因为通货膨胀而上升时，LIFO公司的存货估值要么保持不变（如果单位销售量没有上升），要么落后于美元销售额的上升（如果单位销售量有上升）。在这两种情况下，美元周转率都会增加。

The use of last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory-valuation methods serves to increase the reported turnover rate during inflationary times. When dollar sales are rising because of inflation, inventory valuations of a LIFO company either will remain level (if unit sales are not rising) or will trail the rise in dollar sales (if unit sales are rising). In either case, dollar turnover will increase.

<br>

在20世纪70年代初，公司向LIFO会计（这会降低公司的报告收益和税单）的转变有了明显的趋势。这种趋势现在似乎已经放缓。不过，由于存在很多LIFO公司，再加上可能还有一些其他公司加入这个行列，可以确保存货的报告周转率还会有进一步的增加。

During the early 1970s, there was a pronounced swing by corporations toward LIFO accounting (which has the effect of lowering a company’s reported earnings and tax bills). The trend now seems to have slowed. Still, the existence of a lot of LIFO companies, plus the likelihood that some others will join the crowd, ensures some further increase in the reported turnover of inventory.

## 收益可能很微薄 The gains are apt to be modest

对于固定资产来说，假设通货膨胀率影响所有产品的程度相同，那么通货膨胀率的上升最初会导致营业额增加。这是因为销售额会立即反映新的价格水平，而固定资产账户则只会逐渐反映这种变化，即在现有资产被淘汰并以新价格替换时。显然，公司替换资产的速度越慢，营业额比率就会越高。但是，这种行为在完成一个替换周期后就会停止。假设通货膨胀率保持不变，销售额和固定资产将以通货膨胀率的速度同步上升。

In the case of fixed assets, any rise in the inflation rate, assuming it affects all products equally, will initially have the effect of increasing turnover. That is true because sales will immediately reflect the new price level, while the fixed asset account will reflect the change only gradually, i.e., as existing assets are retired and replaced at the new prices. Obviously, the more slowly a company goes about this replacement process, the more the turnover ratio will rise. The action stops, however, when a replacement cycle is completed. Assuming a constant rate of inflation, sales and fixed assets will then begin to rise in concert at the rate of inflation.

<br>

总之，通货膨胀会带来一些营业额比率的提高。由于采用了后进先出法（LIFO），一些改善是肯定的；而如果通货膨胀加速，由于销售额比固定资产上升得更快，一些改善也是可能的。但是，收益可能很微薄，并不足以显著提高股本资本的回报率。在截至1975年的十年间，尽管通货膨胀普遍加速，并且广泛采用了后进先出法（LIFO）会计，财富500强的营业额比率只从1.18/1上升到1.29/1。

To sum up, inflation will produce some gains in turnover ratios. Some improvement would be certain because of LIFO and some would be possible (if inflation accelerates) because of sales rising more rapidly than fixed assets. But the gains are apt to be modest and not of a magnitude to produce substantial improvement in returns on equity capital. During the decade ending in 1975, despite generally accelerating inflation and the extensive use of LIFO accounting, the turnover ratio of the Fortune 500 went only from 1.18/1 to 1.29/1.

<br>

更便宜的杠杆？不太可能。高通胀率通常会导致借贷变得更昂贵，而不是更便宜。飞涨的通胀率造成飞涨的资本需求；而借贷者，随着他们对长期合同越来越不信任，也变得更加苛刻。但即使利率没有进一步上升，杠杆的成本也会变得更高，因为现在企业账面上的债务成本低于替换它们的成本。而替换是必须的，因为现有的债务到期了。总的来说，未来杠杆成本的变化似乎很可能对股本回报率产生轻微的抑制作用。

Cheaper leverage? Not likely. High rates of inflation generally cause borrowing to become dearer, not cheaper. Galloping rates of inflation create galloping capital needs; and lenders, as they become increasingly distrustful of long-term contracts, become more demanding. But even if there is no further rise in interest rates, leverage will be getting more expensive because the average cost of the debt now on corporate books is less than would be the cost of replacing it. And replacement will be required as the existing debt matures. Overall, then, future changes in the cost of leverage seem likely to have a mildly depressing effect on the return on equity.

<br>

更多的杠杆？美国企业已经使用了许多，如果不是大部分，曾经可用的更多杠杆子弹。这一命题的证据可以在《财富》500强的一些统计数据中看到：在截至1975年的20年中，500强企业的股东权益占总资产的百分比从63%下降到不到50%。换句话说，现在每一美元的股权资本都比以前有更多的杠杆。

More leverage? American business already has fired many, if not most, of the more-leverage bullets once available to it. Proof of that proposition can be seen in some other Fortune 500 statistics: in the 20 years ending in 1975, stockholders’ equity as a percentage of total assets declined for the 500 from 63% to just under 50%. In other words, each dollar of equity capital now is leveraged much more heavily than it used to be.

<br>

## 借贷者学到了什么 What the lenders learned

通胀引起的金融需求的一个讽刺之处是，利润率最高的公司——通常是最好的信用——相对而言需要较少的债务资本。但是利润率低迷的落后者永远得不到足够的资金。借贷者对这个问题比十年前了解得多得多——并且相应地不太愿意让资金饥渴、利润率低下的企业把自己杠杆化到极致。

An irony of inflation-induced financial requirements is that the highly profitable companies — generally the best credits — require relatively little debt capital. But the laggards in profitability never can get enough. Lenders understand this problem much better than they did a decade ago — and are correspondingly less willing to let capital-hungry, low-profitability enterprises leverage themselves to the sky.

<br>

然而，在通货膨胀的条件下，许多公司似乎在未来肯定会采用更多的杠杆，以提高股本回报。他们的管理层会这样做，因为他们将需要大量的资本——往往只是为了做同样的业务量——并且希望在不削减股息或发行股票的情况下获得它，而由于通货膨胀，这些股票不太可能具有吸引力。他们自然的反应是不惜代价地增加债务，就像那些在1960年代争论八分之一点，在1974年感激地找到12%的债务融资的公用事业公司一样。

Nevertheless, given inflationary conditions, many corporations seem sure in the future to turn to still more leverage as a means of shoring up equity returns. Their managements will make that move because they will need enormous amounts of capital — often merely to do the same physical volume of business — and will wish to get it without cutting dividends or making equity offerings that, because of inflation, are not apt to shape up as attractive. Their natural response will be to heap on debt, almost regardless of cost. They will tend to behave like those utility companies that argued over an eighth of a point in the 1960s and were grateful to find 12% debt financing in 1974.

<br>

然而，在目前的利率下，增加的债务对股本回报的作用将小于在1960年代初4%利率下增加的债务。还有一个问题是，较高的债务比率会导致信用评级下降，进而导致利息成本进一步上升。

Added debt at present interest rates, however, will do less for equity returns than did added debt at 4% rates in the early 1960s. There is also the problem that higher debt ratios cause credit ratings to be lowered, creating a further rise in interest costs.

<br>

因此，这是另一种方式，除了我们已经讨论过的方式之外，杠杆成本将会上升。总体而言，杠杆的高成本可能会抵消杠杆的好处。

So that is another way, to be added to those already discussed, in which the cost of leverage will be rising. In total, the higher costs of leverage are likely to offset the benefits of greater leverage.

<br>

此外，在美国企业中已经存在了远远超过传统资产负债表所反映的债务。许多公司有大量与目前员工退休时的工资水平挂钩的养老金义务。在1955-65年低通货膨胀率的情况下，这类计划产生的负债是相当可预测的。今天，没有人真正知道公司最终的义务是什么。但是如果未来通货膨胀率平均为7%，那么现在年薪为12,000美元、加薪不超过生活成本增长的25岁员工，在65岁退休时将赚到180,000美元。

Besides, there is already far more debt in corporate America than is conveyed by conventional balance sheets. Many companies have massive pension obligations geared to whatever pay levels will be in effect when present workers retire. At the low inflation rates of 1955-65, the liabilities arising from such plans were reasonably predictable. Today, nobody can really know the company’s ultimate obligation. But if the inflation rate averages 7% in the future, a 25-year-old employee who is now earning $12,000, and whose raises do no more than match increases in living costs, will be making $180,000 when he retires at 65.

<br>

当然，每年在许多年度报告中都有一个非常精确的数字，声称是未偿付养老金负债。如果这个数字真的可信，一个公司只需拿出这笔钱，加上现有的养老金基金资产，把总金额交给一家保险公司，并让它承担所有的现有养老金负债。可惜，在现实世界中，你很难找到一家保险公司愿意听这样的交易。

Of course, there is a marvelously precise figure in many annual reports each year, purporting to be the unfunded pension liability. If that figure were really believable, a corporation could simply ante up that sum, add to it the existing pension-fund assets, turn the total amount over to an insurance company, and have it assume all the corporation’s present pension liabilities. In the real world, alas, it is impossible to find an insurance company willing even to listen to such a deal.

<br>

美国几乎每一位企业财务长都会对发行“生活成本”债券（一种与价格指数挂钩的不可赎回债券）感到惊恐。但通过私人养老金制度，美国企业实际上承担了大量相当于这种债券的债务。

Virtually every corporate treasurer in America would recoil at the idea of issuing a “cost-of-living” bond — a noncallable obligation with coupons tied to a price index. But through the private pension system, corporate America has in fact taken on a fantastic amount of debt that is the equivalent of such a bond.

<br>

无论是通过传统债务还是与通货膨胀挂钩的“养老金债务”，股东都应该对杠杆持怀疑态度。一个没有债务的企业产生12%的回报，远远优于一个背负沉重债务的企业产生的相同回报。这意味着今天的12%股权回报可能比20年前的12%回报要低。

More leverage, whether through conventional debt or unhooked and indexed “pension debt,” should be viewed with skepticism by shareholders. A 12% return from an enterprise that is debt-free is far superior to the same return achieved by a business hocked to its eyeballs. Which means that today’s 12% equity returns may well be less valuable than the 12% returns of 20 years ago.

<br>

## 纽约更有趣 More fun in New York

降低企业所得税似乎不太可能。投资美国公司的人已经拥有了一种可以被认为是D级股票的东西。A、B和C级股票分别代表联邦、州和市政府的所得税索赔。诚然，这些“投资者”对公司的资产没有任何索赔权；但是，他们却得到了公司收益的很大一部分，包括由D级股东所拥有的部分收益留存所产生的资本增值。

Lower corporate income taxes seem unlikely. Investors in American corporations already own what might be thought of as a Class D stock. The Class A, B, and C stocks are represented by the income-tax claims of the federal, state, and municipal governments. It is true that these “investors” have no claim on the corporation’s assets; however, they get a major share of the earnings, including earnings generated by the equity buildup resulting from retention of part of the earnings owned by the Class D shareholders.

<br>

这些精彩的A类、B类和C类股票的另一个迷人的特点是，它们在公司收益中的份额可以立即、大量地增加，而且不需要付款，只要任何一个“股东”类别的单方投票就可以，例如，国会在A类的情况下采取行动。更有趣的是，有时候其中一个类别会投票增加它在业务中的所有权份额，甚至可以追溯到以前——正如1975年在纽约经营的公司惊恐地发现的那样。无论A类、B类或C类“股东”给自己投票了更大的业务份额，剩下的给D类的部分——这是普通投资者持有的那一部分——就会减少。

A further charming characteristic of these wonderful Class A, B, and C stocks is that their share of the corporation’s earnings can be increased immediately, abundantly, and without payment by the unilateral vote of any one of the “stockholder” classes, e.g., by congressional action in the case of the Class A. To add to the fun, one of the classes will sometimes vote to increase its ownership share in the business retroactively — as companies operating in New York discovered to their dismay in 1975. Whenever the Class A, B, or C “stockholders” vote themselves a larger share of the business, the portion remaining for Class D — that’s the one held by the ordinary investor — declines.

<br>

展望未来，在长期内假设控制A类、B类或C类股票的人会投票减少自己的收益似乎是不明智的。D类股票可能必须努力维持自己的地位。

Looking ahead, it seems unwise to assume that those who control the A, B, and C shares will vote to reduce their own take over the long run. The Class D shares probably will have to struggle to hold their own.

<br>

## 来自联邦贸易委员会（FTC）的坏消息 Bad news from the FTC

我们五种可能提高股本回报率的来源中的最后一种是更广泛的销售运营利润率。这里是一些乐观主义者希望实现重大收益的地方。他们并没有证明自己是错的。但是，在销售美元中只有100美分，而在我们得到剩余的税前利润之前，有很多对这个美元提出要求。主要索赔人是劳动力、原材料、能源和各种非所得税。这些成本在通货膨胀时代似乎不太可能下降。

The last of our five possible sources of increased returns on equity is wider operating margins on sales. Here is where some optimists would hope to achieve major gains. There is no proof that they are wrong. But there are only 100 cents in the sales dollar and a lot of demands on that dollar before we get down to the residual, pretax profits. The major claimants are labor, raw materials, energy, and various non-income taxes. The relative importance of these costs hardly seems likely to decline during an age of inflation.

<br>

最近的统计证据也不支持在通货膨胀时期，利润率会扩大的说法。在1965年结束的十年里，这是一个相对低通胀的时期，联邦贸易委员会每季度报告的制造业公司的平均年度销售税前利润率为8.6%。在1975年结束的十年里，平均利润率为8%。换句话说，尽管通货膨胀率显著提高，但利润率却下降了。

Recent statistical evidence, furthermore, does not inspire confidence in the proposition that margins will widen in a period of inflation. In the decade ending in 1965, a period of relatively low inflation, the universe of manufacturing companies reported on quarterly by the Federal Trade Commission had an average annual pretax margin on sales of 8.6%. In the decade ending in 1975, the average margin was 8%. Margins were down, in other words, despite a very considerable increase in the inflation rate.

<br>

如果企业能够根据替代成本来定价，那么在通货膨胀时期，利润率就会扩大。但事实很简单，尽管人们普遍认为大型企业拥有市场力量，但它们却没有做到这一点。替代成本核算几乎总是显示，在过去的十年里，企业的收益显著下降。如果石油、钢铁和铝等主要行业真的拥有人们所认为的寡头垄断力量，那么我们只能得出这样的结论：它们的定价政策非常克制。

If business was able to base its prices on replacement costs, margins would widen in inflationary periods. But the simple fact is that most large businesses, despite a widespread belief in their market power, just don’t manage to pull it off. Replacement cost accounting almost always shows that corporate earnings have declined significantly in the past decade. If such major industries as oil, steel, and aluminum really have the oligopolistic muscle imputed to them, one can only conclude that their pricing policies have been remarkably restrained.

<br>

这就是完整的阵容：五个可以提高普通股权益回报率的因素，但根据我的分析，在高通货膨胀时期，它们都不太可能带我们走向这个方向。你可能比我更乐观。但请记住，在12%左右的回报率已经伴随我们很长时间了。

There you have the complete lineup: five factors that can improve returns on common equity, none of which, by my analysis, are likely to take us very far in that direction in periods of high inflation. You may have emerged from this exercise more optimistic than I am. But remember, returns in the 12% area have been with us a long time.

<br>

## 投资者的方程式 The investor’s equation

即使你同意12%的股权息率或多或少是不变的，你仍然可能希望在未来几年里做得很好。这是有可能的。毕竟，很多投资者用它赚了很长时间的钱。但是你未来的结果将受到三个变量的影响：账面价值和市场价值之间的关系，税率和通货膨胀率。

Even if you agree that the 12% equity coupon is more or less immutable, you still may hope to do well with it in the years ahead. It’s conceivable that you will. After all, a lot of investors did well with it for a long time. But your future results will be governed by three variables: the relationship between book value and market value, the tax rate, and the inflation rate.

<br>

让我们来看看有关账面价值和市场价值的一些算术。当股票持续以账面价值出售时，一切都很简单。如果一只股票的账面价值是100美元，平均市场价值也是100美元，那么企业12%的收益就会为投资者带来12%的回报（减去那些我们暂时忽略的摩擦成本）。如果派息率是50%，我们的投资者将通过股息获得6美元，另外6美元来自企业账面价值的增加，这当然也会反映在他持有的股票的市场价值上。

Let’s wade through a little arithmetic about book and market value. When stocks consistently sell at book value, it’s all very simple. If a stock has a book value of $100 and also an average market value of $100, 12% earnings by business will produce a 12% return for the investor (less those frictional costs, which we’ll ignore for the moment). If the payout ratio is 50%, our investor will get $6 via dividends and a further $6 from the increase in the book value of the business, which will, of course, be reflected in the market value of his holdings.

<br>

如果股票以账面价值的150%出售，情况就会改变。投资者将收到相同的6美元现金股息，但这现在只代表他150美元成本的4%回报。企业的账面价值仍然会增加6%（至106美元），而投资者持有的市值，按照账面价值的150%一致计算，也会相应地增加6%（至159美元）。但投资者的总回报，即来自升值和股息的回报，只有10%，而不是企业赚取的基础12%。

If the stock sold at 150% of book value, the picture would change. The investor would receive the same $6 cash dividend, but it would now represent only a 4% return on his $150 cost. The book value of the business would still increase by 6% (to $106) and the market value of the investor’s holdings, valued consistently at 150% of book value, would similarly increase by 6% (to $159). But the investor’s total return, i.e., from appreciation plus dividends, would be only 10% versus the underlying 12% earned by the business.

<br>

当投资者以低于账面价值的价格买入时，过程就反过来了。例如，如果股票以账面价值的80%出售，相同的收益和派息假设将产生7.5%的股息回报（$6在$80的价格上）和6%的升值回报——总回报为13.5%。换句话说，你通过以折扣价买入而不是溢价买入而获得更好的回报，正如常识所告诉你的那样。

When the investor buys in below book value, the process is reversed. For example, if the stock sells at 80% of book value, the same earnings and payout assumptions would yield 7.5% from dividends ($6 on an $80 price) and 6% from appreciation — a total return of 13.5%. In other words, you do better by buying at a discount rather than a premium, just as common sense would suggest.

<br>

在战后的年代，道琼斯工业指数的市值曾低至账面价值的84%（1974年），也曾高达232%（1965年）；大部分时间，这个比率都远高于100%。（今年春天初，它大约是110%。）让我们假设，在未来，这个比率将接近100%，意味着股票投资者可以获得全部12%的收益。至少，在税收和通货膨胀之前，他们可以获得这个数字。

During the postwar years, the market value of the Dow Jones industrials has been as low as 84% of book value (in 1974) and as high as 232% (in 1965); most of the time the ratio has been well over 100%. (Early this spring, it was around 110%.) Let’s assume that in the future the ratio will be something close to 100%, meaning that investors in stocks could earn the full 12%. At least, they could earn that figure before taxes and before inflation.

<br>

## 7%的税后收益 7% after taxes

税收会从12%的收益中咬掉多大一块呢？对于个人投资者来说，合理的假设是，联邦、州和地方所得税平均可能会在股息上收取50%，在资本利得上收取30%。大多数投资者的边际税率可能略低于这些数字，但许多持有较大股份的投资者会面临更高的税率。根据新的税法，正如《财富》杂志上个月所观察到的，一个高收入的投资者，在一个税收很重的城市，他的资本利得的边际税率可能高达56%。

How large a bite might taxes take out of the 12%? For individual investors, it seems reasonable to assume that federal, state, and local income taxes will average perhaps 50% on dividends and 30% on capital gains. A majority of investors may have marginal rates somewhat below these, but many with larger holdings will experience substantially higher rates. Under the new tax law, as Fortune observed last month, a high-income investor in a heavily taxed city could have a marginal rate on capital gains as high as 56%.

<br>

那么，让我们用50%和30%作为个人投资者的代表。让我们也假设，与近期的经验一致，以12%的股本收益率赚钱的公司支付5%的现金股息（税后2.5%），并保留7%，这些保留的收益产生相应的市值增长（税后30%的4.9%）。那么，税后回报率就是7.4%。可能这应该四舍五入到大约7%，以考虑摩擦成本。为了进一步推进我们的股票作为伪装债券的论点，那么，股票可以被视为个人投资者的7%免税永续债券的等价物。

So let’s use 50% and 30% as representative for individual investors. Let’s also assume, in line with recent experience, that corporations earning 12% on equity pay out 5% in cash dividends (2.5% after tax) and retain 7%, with those retained earnings producing a corresponding market-value growth (4.9% after the 30% tax). The after-tax return, then, would be 7.4%. Probably this should be rounded down to about 7% to allow for frictional costs. To push our stocks-as-disguised-bonds thesis one notch further, then, stocks might be regarded as the equivalent, for individuals, of 7% tax-exempt perpetual bonds.

<br>

## 无人知晓的数字 The number nobody knows

这就引出了一个关键的问题——通货膨胀率。这个问题没有人知道答案——包括那些几年前觉得只要轻轻地在这里那里推一推，失业率和通货膨胀率就会像受过训练的海豹一样听话的政客、经济学家和权威专家。

Which brings us to the crucial question — the inflation rate. No one knows the answer on this one — including the politicians, economists, and Establishment pundits, who felt, a few years back, that with slight nudges here and there unemployment and inflation rates would respond like trained seals.

<br>

但是许多迹象似乎对价格稳定不利：通货膨胀现在已经是全球性的；我们社会中主要群体利用他们的选举力量来转移而不是解决经济问题的倾向；如果问题可以推迟，就表现出不愿意解决甚至最重要的问题（例如能源和核扩散）的态度；以及一个政治制度，如果立法者的行为看起来能产生短期利益，即使他们最终的影响将是加剧长期痛苦，也会让他们连任。

But many signs seem negative for stable prices: the fact that inflation is now worldwide; the propensity of major groups in our society to utilize their electoral muscle to shift, rather than solve, economic problems; the demonstrated unwillingness to tackle even the most vital problems (e.g., energy and nuclear proliferation) if they can be postponed; and a political system that rewards legislators with reelection if their actions appear to produce short-term benefits even though their ultimate imprint will be to compound long-term pain.

<br>

大多数在政治职位上的人，完全可以理解，他们坚决反对通货膨胀，同时又坚决支持导致通货膨胀的政策。（这种精神分裂并没有让他们失去现实感，然而；国会议员们已经确保了他们的退休金——与私营部门授予的几乎所有退休金不同——在退休后与生活成本变化挂钩。）

Most of those in political office, quite understandably, are firmly against inflation and firmly in favor of policies producing it. (This schizophrenia hasn’t caused them to lose touch with reality, however; Congressmen have made sure that their pensions — unlike practically all granted in the private sector — are indexed to cost-of-living changes after retirement.)

<br>

关于未来通货膨胀率的讨论通常探讨货币和财政政策的微妙之处。这些是决定任何特定通货膨胀方程式结果的重要变量。但是，在源头上，和平时期的通货膨胀是一个政治问题，而不是一个经济问题。人类行为，而不是货币行为，是关键。而当非常人性化的政治家在下一次选举和下一代之间做出选择时，通常会发生什么是很明显的。

Discussions regarding future inflation rates usually probe the subtleties of monetary and fiscal policies. These are important variables in determining the outcome of any specific inflationary equation. But, at the source, peacetime inflation is a political problem, not an economic problem. Human, behavior, not monetary behavior, is the key. And when very human politicians choose between the next election and the next generation, it’s clear what usually happens.

<br>

这样的宽泛的概括并不能产生精确的数字。但在我看来，未来几年的通货膨胀率很有可能平均为7%。我希望这个预测是错的。而且很可能是。预测通常告诉我们更多的是预测者而不是未来。你可以自由地将你自己的通货膨胀率因素纳入投资者的方程式中。但如果你预见到一个平均2%或3%的率，那么你戴的眼镜和我不一样。

Such broad generalizations do not produce precise numbers. However, it seems quite possible to me that inflation rates will average 7% in future years. I hope this forecast proves to be wrong. And it may well be. Forecasts usually tell us more of the forecaster than of the future. You are free to factor your own inflation rate into the investor’s equation. But if you foresee a rate averaging 2% or 3%, you are wearing different glasses than I am.

<br>

所以我们就这样：税前和通货膨胀之前是12%；税后和通货膨胀之前是7%；税后和通货膨胀之后可能是零。这听起来几乎不像是一个能让电视上那些奔跑的牛群持续冲刺的公式。

So there we are: 12% before taxes and inflation; 7% after taxes and before inflation; and maybe zero percent after taxes and inflation. It hardly sounds like a formula that will keep all those cattle stampeding on TV.

<br>

作为一个普通股东，你会有更多的美元，但你可能没有更多的购买力。拜拜了，本杰明·富兰克林（“省下一分钱就是赚了一分钱”），迎接米尔顿·弗里德曼（“一个人消费他的资本和投资他的资本没什么区别”）。

As a common stockholder you will have more dollars, but you may have no more purchasing power. Out with Ben Franklin (“a penny saved is a penny earned”) and in with Milton Friedman (“a man might as well consume his capital as invest it”).

<br>

## 寡妇们没有注意到的事情 What widows don’t notice

算术很清楚地表明，通货膨胀是一种比我们的立法机关制定的任何税收都更具破坏性的税收。通货膨胀税有着惊人的消耗资本的能力。对于一个把她的积蓄放在5%存折账户里的寡妇来说，她在零通货膨胀时期对她的利息收入缴纳100%所得税，或者在5%通货膨胀的年份不缴纳任何所得税，这没有什么区别。无论哪种方式，她都被“征税”了一种让她没有任何真正收入的方式。她花的任何钱都是直接从资本中来的。她会觉得120%的所得税是荒谬的，但似乎没有注意到6%的通货膨胀在经济上是等同的。

The arithmetic makes it plain that inflation is a far more devastating tax than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures. The inflation tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital. It makes no difference to a widow with her savings in a 5% passbook account whether she pays 100% income tax on her interest income during a period of zero inflation, or pays no income taxes during years of 5% inflation. Either way, she is “taxed” in a manner that leaves her no real income whatsoever. Any money she spends comes right out of capital. She would find outrageous a 120% income tax, but doesn’t seem to notice that 6% inflation is the economic equivalent.

<br>

如果我的通货膨胀假设接近正确，令人失望的结果不是因为市场下跌，而是尽管市场上涨。上个月初，道琼斯指数在920点左右，比10年前高出55点。但是按照通货膨胀调整后，道琼斯指数下降了近345点——从865点降到520点。而且，为了达到这样的结果，道琼斯指数的一半收益都必须从它们的所有者那里扣除并重新投资。

If my inflation assumption is close to correct, disappointing results will occur not because the market falls, but in spite of the fact that the market rises. At around 920 early last month, the Dow was up 55 points from where it was 10 years ago. But adjusted for inflation, the Dow is down almost 345 points — from 865 to 520. And about half of the earnings of the Dow had to be withheld from their owners and reinvested in order to achieve even that result.

<br>

在未来10年里，道琼斯指数将仅仅由12%的股权票息、40%的股息支付率和目前110%的市净率的组合而翻倍。而如果通货膨胀率为7%，那么在1800点卖出的投资者在缴纳了资本利得税后，仍然会比现在的情况要差得多。

In the next 10 years, the Dow would be doubled just by a combination of the 12% equity coupon, a 40% payout ratio, and the present 110% ratio of market to book value. And with 7% inflation, investors who sold at 1800 would still be considerably worse off than they are today after paying their capital-gains taxes.

<br>

我几乎可以听到一些投资者对这些悲观的想法的反应。他们会认为，无论新的投资时代带来了什么困难，他们总能设法为自己获得优异的回报。他们的成功是极不可能的。而且，从总体上讲，当然是不可能的。如果你觉得你可以在证券市场上跳来跳去，以一种可以抵消通货膨胀税的方式，我很乐意做你的经纪人——但不愿意做你的合伙人。

I can almost hear the reaction of some investors to these downbeat thoughts. It will be to assume that, whatever the difficulties presented by the new investment era, they will somehow contrive to turn in superior results for themselves. Their success is most unlikely. And, in aggregate, of course, impossible. If you feel you can dance in and out of securities in a way that defeats the inflation tax, I would like to be your broker — but not your partner.

<br>

即使是所谓的免税投资者，如养老基金和大学捐赠基金，也无法逃避通货膨胀税。如果我的7%的通货膨胀率的假设是正确的，那么一所大学的财务主管应该把每年赚到的前7%仅仅看作是购买力的补充。捐赠基金在超越通货膨胀的跑步机之前，是没有任何收益的。在7%的通货膨胀和，比如说，总体投资回报率为8%的情况下，这些认为自己免税的机构，实际上是在支付87.5%的“所得税”。

Even the so-called tax-exempt investors, such as pension funds and college endowment funds, do not escape the inflation tax. If my assumption of a 7% inflation rate is correct, a college treasurer should regard the first 7% earned each year merely as a replenishment of purchasing power. Endowment funds are earning nothing until they have outpaced the inflation treadmill. At 7% inflation and, say, overall investment returns of 8%, these institutions, which believe they are tax-exempt, are in fact paying “income taxes” of 87.5%.

<br>

## 社会方程式 The social equation


不幸的是，高通货膨胀率带来的主要问题不是对投资者，而是对整个社会。投资收入只占国民收入的一小部分，如果人均实际收入能够在零实际投资回报的情况下保持健康的增长，社会正义可能会得到提升。

Unfortunately, the major problems from high inflation rates flow not to investors but to society as a whole. Investment income is a small portion of national income, and if per capita real income could grow at a healthy rate alongside zero real investment returns, social justice might well be advanced.

<br>

市场经济给参与者带来了一些不平衡的收益。 声带、解剖结构、体力或智力的正确禀赋可以产生大量关于未来国民产出的索赔支票（股票、债券和其他形式的资本）。 类似地，适当选择祖先可以导致在出生时终生供应此类门票。 如果零实际投资回报将更多的国家产出从这些股东手中转移到同样有价值和勤奋但缺乏中奖人才的公民身上，似乎不太可能对公平的世界构成如此侮辱，以至于冒着神圣干预的风险。

A market economy creates some lopsided payoffs to participants. The right endowment of vocal chords, anatomical structure, physical strength, or mental powers can produce enormous piles of claim checks (stocks, bonds, and other forms of capital) on future national output. Proper selection of ancestors similarly can result in lifetime supplies of such tickets upon birth. If zero real investment returns diverted a bit greater portion of the national output from such stockholders to equally worthy and hardworking citizens lacking jackpot-producing talents, it would seem unlikely to pose such an insult to an equitable world as to risk Divine Intervention.

<br>

但是，以牺牲富裕股东为代价，提高工人福利的潜力并不显著。员工报酬已经是分红总额的28倍，而且很多分红现在流向了养老基金、非营利机构如大学，以及并不富裕的个人股东。在这种情况下，如果我们现在把富裕股东的所有分红都转移到工资中——这是我们只能做一次的事情，就像杀掉一头牛（或者，如果你喜欢，一头猪）——我们只能把实际工资提高不到我们过去从一年的经济增长中获得的那么多。

But the potential for real improvement in the welfare of workers at the expense of affluent stockholders is not significant. Employee compensation already totals 28 times the amount paid out in dividends, and a lot of those dividends now go to pension funds, nonprofit institutions such as universities, and individual stockholders who are not affluent. Under these circumstances, if we now shifted all dividends of wealthy stockholders into wages — something we could do only once, like killing a cow (or, if you prefer, a pig) — we would increase real wages by less than we used to obtain from one year’s growth of the economy.

<br>

## 俄罗斯人也明白这一点 The Russians understand it too

因此，通过通货膨胀对他们投资的影响，削弱富裕阶层，甚至不会为那些不富裕的人提供实质性的短期帮助。他们的经济福祉将随着通货膨胀对经济的总体影响而升降。而这些影响很可能不会是好的。

Therefore, diminishment of the affluent, through the impact of inflation on their investments, will not even provide material short-term aid to those who are not affluent. Their economic well-being will rise or fall with the general effects of inflation on the economy. And those effects are not likely to be good.

<br>

要想实现经济福祉的大幅增长，就需要在现代生产设施中投入大量的实物资本。如果没有不断创造和使用各行各业昂贵的新资本资产，那么巨大的劳动力供给、巨大的消费者需求和巨大的政府承诺只会导致巨大的挫折。这是一个俄罗斯人和洛克菲勒都能理解的方程式。而且，这也是西德和日本取得惊人成功的方程式。高资本积累率使这些国家的生活水平提高的速度远远超过了我们，即使我们在能源方面拥有更优越的地位。

Large gains in real capital, invested in modern production facilities, are required to produce large gains in economic well-being. Great labor availability, great consumer wants, and great government promises will lead to nothing but great frustration without continuous creation and employment of expensive new capital assets throughout industry. That’s an equation understood by Russians as well as Rockefellers. And it’s one that has been applied with stunning success in West Germany and Japan. High capital-accumulation rates have enabled those countries to achieve gains in living standards at rates far exceeding ours, even though we have enjoyed much the superior position in energy.

<br>

要理解通货膨胀对实际资本积累的影响，需要一些数学知识。回到那个12%的股本回报率。这样的收益是在折旧之后计算的，这样假设可以用未来的价格替换现有的生产能力——如果那些工厂和设备可以在未来以与原始成本相似的价格购买的话。

To understand the impact of inflation upon real capital accumulation, a little math is required. Come back for a moment to that 12% return on equity capital. Such earnings are stated after depreciation, which presumably will allow replacement of present productive capacity — if that plant and equipment can be purchased in the future at prices similar to their original cost.

<br>

## 过去的情况 The way it was

假设大约一半的收益用于支付股息，留下6%的股本用于资助未来的增长。如果通货膨胀率很低——比如说2%——那么很大一部分增长就可以是实物产出的实际增长。因为在这种情况下，明年只需要多投资2%的应收账款、存货和固定资产，就可以复制今年的实物产出——留下4%用于投资生产更多实物商品的资产。其中2%用于资助反映通货膨胀的虚幻美元增长，剩下的4%用于资助实际增长。如果人口增长率是1%，那么实物产出的4%增长就相当于人均实际净收入的3%增长。这大致就是我们经济过去发生的情况。

Let’s assume that about half of earnings are paid out in dividends, leaving 6% of equity capital available to finance future growth. If inflation is low — say, 2% — a large portion of that growth can be real growth in physical output. For under these conditions, 2% more will have to be invested in receivables, inventories, and fixed assets next year just to duplicate this year’s physical output — leaving 4% for investment in assets to produce more physical goods. The 2% finances illusory dollar growth reflecting inflation and the remaining 4% finances real growth. If population growth is 1%, the 4% gain in real output translates into a 3% gain in real per capita net income. That, very roughly, is what used to happen in our economy.

<br>

现在把通货膨胀率提高到7%，计算出在为强制性通货膨胀部分的融资后，还剩下多少用于实际增长。答案是没有——如果股息政策和杠杆率保持不变。在12%的收益中支付了一半后，还剩下6%，但这些都被征用了，用于提供与去年的实物交易量相同的美元数量。

Now move the inflation rate to 7% and compute what is left for real growth after the financing of the mandatory inflation component. The answer is nothing — if dividend policies and leverage ratios remain unchanged. After half of the 12% earnings are paid out, the same 6% is left, but it is all conscripted to provide the added dollars needed to transact last year’s physical volume of business.

<br>

许多公司，在正常支付股息后，没有真正的留存收益来资助实物扩张，就会想办法。他们会问自己，我们怎样才能在不惹恼股东的情况下停止或减少股息呢？我有一个好消息要告诉他们：一套现成的蓝图已经准备好了。

Many companies, faced with no real retained earnings with which to finance physical expansion after normal dividend payments, will improvise. How, they will ask themselves, can we stop or reduce dividends without risking stockholder wrath? I have good news for them: a ready-made set of blueprints is available.

<br>

近年来，电力行业几乎没有或没有分红能力。或者，更确切地说，如果投资者同意从他们那里购买股票，他们就有支付股息的能力。1975年，电力公司向普通股股东支付了33亿美元的股息，并要求投资者退还34亿美元。当然，他们也采用了一些向彼得索要钱来支付保罗的技巧，以免获得康埃迪（ED）的声誉。你可能还记得，康埃迪在1974年很不明智地简单地告诉股东，它没有钱支付股息。市场对坦诚的回报是灾难。

In recent years the electric-utility industry has had little or no dividend-paying capacity. Or, rather, it has had the power to pay dividends if investors agree to buy stock from them. In 1975 electric utilities paid common dividends of $3.3 billion and asked investors to return $3.4 billion. Of course, they mixed in a little solicit-Peter-to-pay-Paul technique so as not to acquire a Con Ed (ED) reputation. Con Ed, you will remember, was unwise enough in 1974 to simply tell its shareholders it didn’t have the money to pay the dividend. Candor was rewarded with calamity in the marketplace.

<br>

更精明的公用事业公司会维持——甚至增加——每季度的股息，然后要求股东（无论是老股东还是新股东）把钱寄回来。换句话说，公司发行新股。这种做法使大量的资本流向了税务机关和承销商。然而，每个人似乎都保持着良好的心情（尤其是承销商）。

The more sophisticated utility maintains — perhaps increases — the quarterly dividend and then ask shareholders (either old or new) to mail back the money. In other words, the company issues new stock. This procedure diverts massive amounts of capital to the tax collector and substantial sums to underwriters. Everyone, however, seems to remain in good spirits (particularly the underwriters).

<br>

## AT&T的更多快乐 More joy at AT&T

受到这样的成功的鼓舞，一些公用事业公司想出了一个更快捷的办法。在这种情况下，公司宣布分红，股东缴纳税款，然后——咻——就发行了更多的股票。没有现金交易，尽管IRS，像往常一样，坚持把这笔交易当作现金交易来处理。

Encouraged by such success, some utilities have devised a further shortcut. In this case, the company declares the dividend, the shareholder pays the tax, and — presto — more shares are issued. No cash changes hands, although the IRS, spoilsport as always, persists in treating the transaction as if it had.

<br>

例如，AT&T（T）在1973年推出了一项股息再投资计划。这家公司，公平地说，必须被描述为非常重视股东的，而且考虑到金融的风俗习惯，它采用这个计划必须被视为完全可以理解的。但是这个计划的实质是出自爱丽丝梦游仙境。

AT&T (T), for example, instituted a dividend-reinvestment program in 1973. This company, in fairness, must be described as very stockholder-minded, and its adoption of this program, considering the folkways of finance, must be regarded as totally understandable. But the substance of the program is out of Alice in Wonderland.

<br>

1976年，美国电话电报公司（AT&T）向其约290万股东支付了23亿美元的现金股息。年底时，有64.8万股东（比前一年增加了4.7万）将4.32亿美元（比前一年增加了1.05亿美元）再投资于公司直接提供的额外股份。

In 1976, AT&T paid $2.3 billion in cash dividends to about 2.9 million owners of its common stock. At the end of the year, 648,000 holders (up from 601,000 the previous year) reinvested $432 million (up from $327 million) in additional shares supplied directly by the company.

<br>

就当作是一种乐趣，我们假设所有的AT&T股东最终都参加了这个计划。在这种情况下，股东们根本不会收到任何现金——就像当康埃迪发放股息时一样。然而，每一个290万个股东都会收到通知，他应该按照他在当年被称为“股息”的留存收益的份额缴纳所得税。假设“股息”总计23亿美元，与1976年相同，而且股东们平均要缴纳30%的税，那么他们最终会因为这个奇妙的计划，向IRS支付近7亿美元。想象一下，如果在这种情况下，董事会又将股息提高了一倍，股东们会有多高兴。

Just for fun, let’s assume that all AT&T shareholders ultimately sign up for this program. In that case, no cash at all would be mailed to shareholders — just as when Con Ed passed a dividend. However, each of the 2.9 million owners would be notified that he should pay income taxes on his share of the retained earnings that had that year been called a “dividend.” Assuming that “dividends” totaled $2.3 billion, as in 1976, and that shareholders paid an average tax of 30% on these, they would end up, courtesy of this marvelous plan, paying nearly $700 million to the IRS. Imagine the joy of shareholders, in such circumstances, if the directors were then to double the dividend.

<br>

## 政府会试图做到这一点 The government will try to do it

我们可以预期，随着企业面临真实资本积累的问题，更多地使用伪装的红利削减。但是稍微限制股东的收益并不能完全解决问题。7%的通货膨胀和12%的回报的结合，将减少企业用于资助真实增长的资本流量。

We can expect to see more use of disguised payout reductions as business struggles with the problem of real capital accumulation. But throttling back shareholders somewhat will not entirely solve the problem. A combination of 7% inflation and 12% returns will reduce the stream of corporate capital available to finance real growth.

<br>

随着通货膨胀的影响，传统的私人资本积累方式越来越失效，我们的政府将越来越多地试图影响资本流向工业，无论是像英国那样不成功，还是像日本那样成功。美国似乎缺乏日本式的政府、企业和劳工之间热情合作的文化和历史基础。如果我们幸运的话，我们将避免走英国的路，那里各个部门争夺分配饼干，而不是合力扩大饼干的大小。

And so, as conventional private capital-accumulation methods falter under inflation, our government will increasingly attempt to influence capital flows to industry, either unsuccessfully as in England or successfully as in Japan. The necessary cultural and historical underpinning for a Japanese-style enthusiastic partnership of government, business, and labor seems lacking here. If we are lucky, we will avoid following the English path, where all segments fight over division of the pie rather than pool their energies to enlarge it.

总的来说，然而，似乎很有可能在未来的几年里，我们会听到更多关于投资不足、滞胀和私营部门未能满足需求的失败的消息。

On balance, however, it seems likely that we will hear a great deal more as the years unfold about underinvestment, stagflation, and the failures of the private sector to fulfill needs.

### 正文

退休基金公司依然用着股票的历史表现进行投资决策。这种刻舟求剑式的选股方法在过去就被证明是不可取的，在这次也是如此。

Pension-fund managers continue to make investment decisions with their eyes firmly fixed on the rearview mirror. This generals-fighting-the-last-war approach has proven costly in the past and will likely prove equally costly this time around.

<br>

股票如今的价格水平意味着在未来能带来远超出债券的收益。但是退休基金经理们，常常是出于取悦他们的公司客户的目的（德国谚语：“谁给我面包，我将为他歌唱”），将债券投资的资金配比调整到了史上最高点。

Stocks now sell at levels that should produce long-term returns far superior to bonds. Yet pensions managers, usually encouraged by corporate sponsors they must necessarily please ("whose bread I eat, his song I sing"), are pouring funds in record proportions into bonds.

<br>

而另一方面，买入股市的订单的规模仿佛是用实验室滴管来衡量的。帕金森，也就是提出帕金森法则的作者，可能会说，股票的持有比例取决于近期投资的满意程度。无论是叫做李雷的路人，还是叫做韩梅梅的投资专家，在持股这件事上他们的行为趋势似乎是类似的。让我给你一些数据吧。

Meanwhile, orders for stocks are being placed with an eyedropper. Parkinson--of Parkinson's law fame--might conclude that the enthusiasm of professionals for stocks varies proportionately with the recent pleasure derived from ownership. This always was the way John Q. Public was expected to behave. John Q. Expert seems similarly afflicted. Here's the record.

<br>

1972年，当道琼斯指数上涨了$67.11，达到了$1,020，或者说从年初账面价值的$607上涨了11%的时候，退休基金经理们恨不得买股票的速度能够赶上上涨的速度。1972年权益的购入比例达到了行业总体的净值的105%（也就是说当中有人用了杠杆）。更加红火的上一年更是达到了前所未有的122%的。这两年的蜂拥而至将退休基金的权益资产比例从61%提高到了74% —— 而这个记录性的高比例的时间和道琼斯指数破纪录的新高点的时间巧妙地吻合。投资经理为股票支付的价格越高，他们越为此感到安心。

In 1972, when the Dow earned $67.11, or 11% on beginning book value of 607, it closed the year selling at 1,020, and pension managers couldn't buy stocks fast enough. Purchases of equities in 1972 were 105% of net funds available (i.e., bonds were sold), a record except for the 122% of the even more buoyant prior year. This two-year stampede increased the equity portion of total pension assets from 61% to 74%--an all-time record that coincided nicely with a record-high price for the Dow. The more investment managers paid for stocks, the better they felt about them.

<br>

1973年到1974年，股票市场俯冲而下。1974年，虽然道琼斯最终涨了$99.04，达到了$616，或者说从年初账面价值的$690涨了14%。稳赚的投资机会？哎，可惜面对这样的低价，大家所做的并不是购入而是恐慌；仅有21%的基金可投资净值用于股票投资，这是25年来的最低点。私人未保险的退休基金的持股比例下降到了资产净值的54%，相比在道琼斯指数高上400点时那个看似合理的持股比例，下降了整整20%。

And then the market went into a tailspin in 1973-74. Although the Dow earned $99.04 in 1974, or 14% on beginning book value of 690, it finished the year selling at 616. A bargain? Alas, such bargain prices produced panic rather than purchases; only 21% of net investable funds went into equities that year, a 25-year record low. The proportion of equities held by private noninsured pension plans fell to 54% of net assets, a full 20-point drop from the level deemed appropriate when the Dow was 400 points higher.

<br>

在1976年的时候，退休基金持股的勇气是和股市价格一起上升的，在那时56%的资金用于股票投资。道琼斯那年的收市价格接近1,000，大约比账面价值高了25%。

By 1976, the courage of pension managers rose in tandem with the price level, and 56% of available funds was committed to stocks. The Dow that year averaged close to 1,000, a level then about 25% above book value.

<br>

1978年，股票的价格要远远实惠得多，全年大部分时间价格都是低于账面价值的。然而基金的持股比例达到了历史新低的9%。1979年的第一个季度依然保持着非常类似的低水平。

In 1978, stocks were valued far more reasonably, with the Dow selling below book value most of the time. Yet a new low of 9% of net funds was invested in equities during the year. The first quarter of 1979 continued at very close to the same level.

<br>

这么一来，退休基金的经理们，以一种前无古人的方式，倾向于买入收益率为9%到10%的债券，而且对以等于或低于账面价值买入美国权益的机会说不。但是这些退休基金经理们可能会私下承认，这些美国权益投资，在总体而言长期来看，能够带来13%的账面价值（最近几年的平均值）。而且，这些基金的企业客户管理层们也会压倒性的同意这一观点。

By these actions, pension managers, in record-setting manner, are voting for purchase of bonds--at interest rates of 9% to 10%--and against purchase of American equities at prices aggregating book value or less. But these same pension managers probably would concede that those American equities, in aggregate and over the longer term, would earn about 13% (the average in recent years) on book value. And, overwhelmingly, the managers of their corporate sponsors would agree.

<br>

实际上，很多公司的管理层对权益的态度呈现出双重人格。他们认为自己的公司的股票极端优异。但是，同时，他们也戳章赞成退休基金避开买入普通股的投资决策。同样是这些管理层，在戴着收购并购的帽子的时候，愿意为一家普通的美国公司账面价值支付150%到200%的价格，但是在戴着管理养老金的帽子时，会对相似的以账面价值买入公司股票的行为嗤之以鼻。管理层的管理能力难道真的如此优异？以至于对于能够插手经营的公司支付两倍的价格的行为认为依然合理，并拒绝一倍的价格买入的机会，假如只能拱手让谈判桌对面的同事继续独立经营。

Many corporate managers, in fact, exhibit a bit of schizophrenia regarding equities. They consider their own stocks to be screamingly attractive. But, concomitantly, they stamp approval on pension policies rejecting purchases of common stocks in general. And the boss, while wearing his acquisition hat, will eagerly bid 150% to 200% of book value for businesses typical of corporate America but, wearing his pension hat, will scorn investment in similar companies at book value. Can his own talents be so unique that he is justified both in paying 200 cents on the dollar for a business if he can get his hands on it, and in rejecting it as an unwise pension investment at 100 cents on the dollar if it must be left to be run by his companions at the Business Roundtable?

<br>

一个简单的条件反射可能是这样令人困惑的行为的主要原因。在过去的十年，股票为养老基金的公司客户和他们所雇佣的投资基金经理带来了痛苦。双方不太想回首往事。但是这样的痛苦并不是因为公司经营不善，而是股票的表现不及公司表现。这样的低迷表现不会永远持续下去，就像前段时间股票的超常表现吸引了养老基金以高价购入权益投资的情况一样无法持续。

A simple Pavlovian response may be the major cause of this puzzling behavior. During the last decade, stocks have produced pain--both for corporate sponsors and for the investment managers the sponsors hire. Neither group wishes to return to the scene of the accident. But the pain has not been produced because business has performed badly, but rather because stocks have underperformed business. Such underperformance cannot prevail indefinitely, any more than could the earlier overperformance of stocks versus business that lured pension money into equities at high prices.

<br>

在未来，比如说20年后，到期日是1999年的9.5%收益率的一系列美国公司债券有没有可能会提供比一系列以账面价值出售的蓝筹股更高的收益？这样的可能性看起来非常低。权益投资只有在重大的长期走低或者在20年的最后几年恰好遇到糟糕到难以置信的熊市时才显得不够好。如果市场的市盈率在未来20年逐步改善（我们可以预期13%的平均权益投资收益），那么目前的买入时机将会带来超出13%收益的。这个时候的收益率为9.5%的债券怎么会是更好的投资呢？

Can better results be obtained over, say, 20 years from a group of 9 1/2% bonds of leading American companies maturing in 1999 than from a group of Dow-type equities purchased, in aggregate, at around book value and likely to earn, in aggregate, around 13% on that book value? The probabilities seem exceptionally low. The choice of equities would prove inferior only if either a major sustained decline in return on equity occurs or a ludicrously low valuation of earnings prevails at the end of the 20-year period. Should price/earnings ratios expand over the 20-year period--and that 13% return on equity be averaged--purchases made now at book value will result in better than a 13% annual return. How can bonds at only 9 1/2% be a better buy?

<br>

让我们这么想，道琼斯指数的账面价值相当于债券的票面价值，或者说是债券的本金。然后我们可以把大概是13%的期望平均收益视为某种浮动利率债券（息票的一部分将会被加入到本金，就像是美国储蓄债券）。目前我们可以用非常大的折价买入“道琼斯债券”（以大约840的价格买入940的本金额度，目前道琼斯的账面价值。这个数字来自于旧式的道琼斯指数算法，没有经过重整。如果使用新式算法，那么收益将会略高，账面价值将会略低）。这么一个道琼斯债券可以以折价买入并获得13%的平均息票率。相比传统的需要以平价买入的9.5%收益率20年债券，在我看来像是一个好得多的长线投资，尽管息票会随着市场环境发生波动。

Think for a moment of book value of the Dow as equivalent to par, or the principal value of a bond. And think of the 13% or so expectable average rate of earnings on that book value as a sort of fluctuating coupon on the bond--a portion of which is retained to add to principal amount just like the interest return on U.S. Savings Bonds. Currently our "Dow Bond" can be purchased at a significant discount (at about 840 vs. 940 "principal amount," or book value of the Dow. Figures are based on the old Dow, prior to the recent substitutions. The returns would be moderately higher and the book values somewhat lower if the new Dow had been used.). That Dow Bond purchased at a discount with an average coupon of 13%--even though the coupon will fluctuate with business conditions--seems to me to be a long-term investment far superior to a conventional 9 1/2% 20-year bond purchased at par.

<br>

当然了，没有人能保证未来企业的收益会达到平均13%的水平。养老基金投资经理避开股票的一个可能的原因是他们预期未来十年的权益投资收益将会大幅下降。但是，我并不认为大部分投资经理是因为这个原因。

Of course, there is no guarantee that future corporate earnings will average 13%. It may be that some pension managers shun stocks because they expect reported returns on equity to fall sharply in the next decade. However, I don't believe such a view is widespread.

<br>

而事实是，投资经理认为股票不如债券是出于以下两个想法。有些人认为当前的收入普遍被高估，在考虑替换成本的折旧后的实际的收入是一个低得多的数字。因此，他们认为，13%的收益率实际并不存在。但是这一观点在一些投资领域并不成立，比如人寿保险，银行，火灾及意外保险，金融公司，以及服务类公司。

Instead, investment managers usually set forth two major objections to the thought that stocks should now be favored over bonds. Some say earnings currently are overstated, with real earnings after replacement-value depreciation far less than those reported. Thus, they say, real 13% earnings aren't available. But that argument ignores the evidence in such investment areas as life insurance, banking, fire-casualty insurance, finance companies, service businesses, etc.

<br>

在这些行业中，使用替换成本会计方法和使用传统会计将会获得同样的财报数据。将这些行业的龙头公司的股票构建的投资组合将会有着接近账面价值的市场价值，并能提供13%或以上的收益率。更何况，我没见过哪个公司的管理层因为替换成本会计方法的事情，拒绝过13%收益率的投资。

In those industries, replacement-value accounting would produce results virtually identical with those produced by conventional accounting. And yet, one can put together a very attractive package of large companies in those fields with an expectable return of 13% or better on book value and with a price which, in aggregate, approximates book value. Furthermore, I see no evidence that corporate managers turn their backs on 13% returns in their acquisition decisions because of replacement-value accounting considerations.

<br>

第二个论据是，关于未来我们总是有太多的问号；难道不是等一切安定下来以后才是更好的时机吗？你应该听过“广积粮，高筑墙，缓称王”这样类似的话。在市场的拐点到来之前，我们需要接受两个不太令人愉悦的事实：未来永远不可知；在市场普遍乐观的时候，股价也变的高不可攀。不确定性其实是长线投资者的朋友。

A second argument is made that there are just too many question marks about the near future; wouldn't it be better to wait until things clear up a bit? You know the prose: "Maintain buying reserves until current uncertainties are resolved," etc. Before reaching for that crutch, face up to two unpleasant facts: The future is never clear; you pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus. Uncertainty actually is the friend of the buyer of long-term values.

<br>

如果要找最适合长线投资的人，那一定是退休基金经理。如果说公司的管理层们在进行溢价收购之前需要频繁的大额举债，大部分的退休基金基本不存在这样的资金限制。如果他们打算进行长线投资，就像他们现在买入20，30年期债券这样，他们有正当的理由这么做。他们可以，而且应该，以长线投资合伙的态度和期待买入股票。

If anyone can afford to have such a long-term perspective in making investment decisions, it should be pension-fund managers. While corporate managers frequently incur large obligations in order to acquire businesses at premium prices, most pension plans have very minor flow-of-funds problems. If they wish to invest for the long term--as they do in buying those 20- and 30-year bonds they now embrace--they certainly are in a position to do so. They can, and should, buy stocks with the attitude and expectations of an investor entering into a long-term partnership.

<br>

那些为了躲避养老基金管理责任的公司管理层们，正在为他们的那些图简单，不变通，或者赶时髦的投资决策付出代价。养老基金资产大概占据了整个行业1/3的净值，这一比例远大于其他的行业的平均水平。因此，此类资产的管理不善常常意味着公司最主要业务的经营不善。杰出的投资收益将会为企业客户带来巨大的收益，并且将会为未来的支付义务提供保障。

Corporate managers who duck responsibility for pension management by making easy, conventional or faddish decisions are making an expensive mistake. Pension assets probably total about one-third of overall industrial net worth and, of course, bulk far larger in the case of many specific industrial corporations. Thus, poor management of those assets frequently equates to poor management of the largest single segment of the business. Soundly achieved higher returns will produce significantly greater earnings for the corporate sponsors and will also enhance the security and prospective payments available to pensioners.

<br>

那些调低权益投资比例的基金经理，要么是对于美国公司的未来高度悲观，要么认为自己在找准时机用更低的价格抄底。在不远的未来可能确实会有金融市场普遍低迷的情况，从而有着更好入场机会；这样的机会在任何时候都会存在。但是你也同样会发现在这些时候，此时的未来看起来又是变化莫测又是不如人意。那些想等待“更好的时机”买入股票的人在这样的环境下很有可能只会继续等到下一个牛市到来以后才如梦初醒。

Managers currently opting for lower equity ratios either have a highly negative opinion of future American business results or expect to be nimble enough to dance back into stocks at even lower levels. There may well be some period in the near future when financial markets are demoralized and much better buys are available in equities; that possibility exists at all times. But you can be sure that at such a time the future will seem neither predictable nor pleasant. Those now awaiting a "better time" for equity investing are highly likely to maintain that posture until well into the next bull market.

福布斯评论：48岁的沃伦巴菲特平易近人。对于办公的地点，他选择家乡的奥马哈而不是华尔街的林立高楼。但是业内的人都认为这位本杰明格雷汉姆的学徒是这个时代最成功的基金经理。巴菲特在50年代和60年代为他本人以及他的客户带来了财富，但是在1969年，在找不到合适的投资机会的那一年，决定终止业务。在1974年的后半段，当道琼斯工业指数跌破600点，市场一片悲鸣时，他对福布斯的记者这么说道：“我像是一个性欲过剩的男人走进后宫。此时是投资的时刻。”几个月内，美国股市遇到了历史上最大的牛市，道琼斯在一年多一点的时间里上涨了将近450点。那么如今，巴菲特的想法又是如何？在这篇文章里，他的观点简单明了：现在是买入的时机。

Warren Buffett is a down-to-earth man of 48 who prefers to operate out of his native Omaha rather than in the canyons of Wall Street, but the pros regard him as possibly the most successful living money manager, a direct descendant of the legendary Ben Graham under whom he studied. Buffett made a fortune for himself and his clients in the Fifties and Sixties but threw in the towel in 1969 because he could no longer find bargains. Then in late 1974, when the Dow Jones industrials were below 600 and the air was thick with doom, he told Forbes: "I feel like an oversexed man in a harem. This is the time to start investing." Within months, the greatest rally in history began, with the DJI running almost 450 points in a bit over a year. What does Buffett think now? In this article, he puts it bluntly: Now is the time to buy.

<p class="small">原文标题：The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville</p>

<br>

格雷厄姆和多德“寻找相对于价格有显著安全边际的价值”这种证券分析方法是否过时了？今天写教科书的许多教授都说是。他们认为股市是有效的；也就是说，股价反映了关于公司前景和经济状况的所有已知信息。这些理论家认为，没有被低估的股票，因为有聪明的证券分析师利用所有可用的信息来确保始终合理的价格。那些年复一年看似击败市场的投资者只是幸运。一位今天的教科书作者写道：“如果价格充分反映了可用信息，这种投资技巧就被排除了。”

Is the Graham and Dodd “look for values with a significant margin of safety relative to prices” approach to security analysis out of date? Many of the professors who write textbooks today say yes. They argue that the stock market is efficient; that is, that stock prices reflect everything that is known about a company’s prospects and about the state of the economy. There are no undervalued stocks, these theorists argue, because there are smart security analysts who utilize all available information to ensure unfailingly appropriate prices. Investors who seem to beat the market year after year are just lucky. “If prices fully reflect available information, this sort of investment adeptness is ruled out,” writes one of today’s textbook authors.

<br>

好吧，也许可以。但是我想向你介绍一群投资者，他们年复一年地击败了标准普尔500指数。他们是靠纯粹的运气做到这一点的假设至少值得检验。这种检验的关键是这些赢家都是我所熟知的，并且在很久以前就被我认定为优秀的投资者，最近的一次认定是在十五年前。如果没有这个条件——也就是说，如果我今天早上才在成千上万的记录中为你挑选了几个名字——我会建议你现在就停止阅读。我还应该补充说，所有这些记录都经过了审计。我还应该进一步补充说，我认识许多与这些经理人合作过的人，这些参与者多年来收到的支票与所述记录相符。

Well, maybe. But I want to present to you a group of investors who have, year in and year out, beaten the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index. The hypothesis that they do this by pure chance is at least worth examining. Crucial to this examination is the fact that these winners were all well known to me and pre-identified as superior investors, the most recent identification occurring over fifteen years ago. Absent this condition - that is, if I had just recently searched among thousands of records to select a few names for you this morning — I would advise you to stop reading right here. I should add that all of these records have been audited. And I should further add that I have known many of those who have invested with these managers, and the checks received by those participants over the years have matched the stated records.

<br>

在我们开始这个考察之前，我想让你想象一下一个全国性的硬币翻转比赛。假设我们明天早上让2.25亿美国人起床，我们要求他们都下注一美元。他们在日出时出门，他们都猜测硬币的正反面。如果他们猜对了，他们就从猜错的人那里赢得一美元。每天输的人就退出，第二天的赌注就会增加，因为所有之前赢得的钱都要拿出来。经过十次翻转，十天后，美国就会有大约22万人连续猜对了十次。他们每个人都会赢得一千多美元。

Before we begin this examination, I would like you to imagine a national coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.

<br>

现在这群人可能会开始有点得意忘形，人性就是这样。他们可能会试图保持谦虚，但在鸡尾酒会上，他们偶尔会向异性吸引力强的人承认他们的技巧是什么，以及他们对翻转领域带来了多么神奇的洞察力。

Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.

<br>

假设赢家从输家那里得到了适当的奖励，在接下来的十天里，我们将有215个人成功地连续猜对了20次硬币的正反面，而且通过这个练习，他们每个人都把一美元变成了一百多万美元。2.25亿美元将会损失，2.25亿美元将会赢得。

Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over $1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would have been won.

<br>

到那时，这群人真的会失去理智。他们可能会写一些书，比如《我如何在二十天内用一美元换成一百万美元，每天只工作三十秒》。更糟糕的是，他们可能会飞遍全国，参加有关高效硬币翻转的研讨会，并对怀疑的教授说：“如果这是不可能的，为什么我们有215个人？”

By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will probably write books on “How I turned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet, they’ll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors with, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”

<br>

到那时，可能会有一位商学院教授无礼地提出这样一个事实：如果有2.25亿只猩猩进行了类似的实验，结果会大致相同——215只自负的猩猩连续翻了20次硬币。

By then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much the same — 215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning flips.

<br>

我认为，然而，我将要展示的例子有一些重要的不同之处。首先，如果（a）你把2.25亿只猩猩按照美国人口的分布大致分布；如果（b）20天后剩下215个赢家；如果（c）你发现40个来自奥马哈的某个动物园，你会很确定你发现了什么。所以你可能会出去问问动物园管理员他们吃了什么，他们有没有特别的锻炼，他们读了什么书，还有谁知道呢。也就是说，如果你发现了一些非常不寻常的成功集中，你可能想看看你能否找到一些不寻常的特征的集中，这些特征可能是因果因素。

I would argue, however, that there are some important differences in the examples I am going to present. For one thing, if (a) you had taken 225 million orangutans distributed roughly as the U.S. population is; if (b) 215 winners were left after 20 days; and if (c) you found that 40 came from a particular zoo in Omaha, you would be pretty sure you were on to something. So you would probably go out and ask the zookeeper about what he’s feeding them, whether they had special exercises, what books they read, and who knows what else. That is, if you found any really extraordinary concentrations of success, you might want to see if you could identify concentrations of unusual characteristics that might be causal factors.

<br>

科学探究自然地遵循这样的模式。如果你试图分析一种罕见的癌症的可能原因——比如说，在美国每年有1500例——而你发现其中400例发生在蒙大拿州的一个小矿镇，你就会对那里的水，或者那些患者的职业，或者其他变量感兴趣。你知道不是随机的巧合，400个来自一个小地区。你不一定知道因果因素，但你会知道在哪里寻找。


Scientific inquiry naturally follows such a pattern. If you were trying to analyze possible causes of a rare type of cancer — with, say, 1,500 cases a year in the United States — and you found that 400 of them occurred in some little mining town in Montana, you would get very interested in the water there, or the occupation of those afflicted, or other variables. You know it’s not random chance that 400 come from a small area. You would not necessarily know the causal factors, but you would know where to search.

<br>

我认为，除了地理之外，还有其他方式来定义一个起源。除了地理起源，还有我所说的智力起源。我想你会发现，在投资界成功的硬币翻转者中，有不成比例的多数来自一个非常小的智力村庄，可以称之为格雷厄姆-多德斯维尔。这个村庄的获胜者集中度是无法用偶然来解释的，可以追溯到这个特殊的智力村庄。

I submit to you that there are ways of defining an origin other than geography. In addition to geographical origins, there can be what I call an intellectual origin. I think you will find that a disproportionate number of successful coin-flippers in the investment world came from a very small intellectual village that could be called Graham-and-Doddsville. A concentration of winners that simply cannot be explained by chance can be traced to this particular intellectual village.

<br>

即使是这样的集中也可能无关紧要。也许有100个人只是在模仿某个非常有说服力的人物的抛硬币的叫法。当他叫正面时，100个追随者就自动地用同样的方式叫那枚硬币。如果这个领导者是最后剩下的215人中的一员，那么100个人来自同一个智力来源的事实就没有什么意义。你只是把一种情况当作了一百种情况。同样，假设你生活在一个强烈的父权社会，美国每个家庭恰好由十个成员组成。进一步假设，父权文化是如此强大，以至于在第一天出去的2.25亿人中，每个家庭的成员都认同父亲的叫法。现在，在20天的时间里，你会有215个赢家，你会发现他们来自只有21.5个家庭。一些天真的人可能会说，这表明存在着巨大的遗传因素作为成功抛硬币的解释。但是，这当然没有任何意义，因为它只是意味着你没有215个独立的赢家，而是有21.5个随机分布的家庭是赢家。

Conditions could exist that would make even that concentration unimportant. Perhaps 100 people were simply imitating the coin-flipping call of some terribly persuasive personality. When he called heads, 100 followers automatically called that coin the same way. If the leader was part of the 215 left at the end, the fact that 100 came from the same intellectual origin would mean nothing. You would simply be identifying one case as a hundred cases. Similarly, let’s assume that you lived in a strongly patriarchal society and every family in the United States conveniently consisted of ten members. Further assume that the patriarchal culture was so strong that, when the 225 million people went out the first day, every member of the family identified with the father’s call. Now, at the end of the 20-day period, you would have 215 winners, and you would find that they came from only 21.5 families. Some naive types might say that this indicates an enormous hereditary factor as an explanation of successful coin-flipping. But, of course, it would have no significance at all because it would simply mean that you didn’t have 215 individual winners, but rather 21.5 randomly distributed families who were winners.

<br>

在我想要考虑的这群成功的投资者中，有一个共同的智慧之父，本·格雷厄姆。但是这位智慧之父的子女们在决定如何“猜测”时却有着非常不同的方式。他们去了不同的地方，买卖了不同的股票和公司，但他们的综合表现却是随机机会无法解释的。当然也无法用他们都在按照一个领导者发出的信号来做出决定这样的事实来解释。智慧之父只是提出了做出猜测决策的智慧理论，但每个学生都自己决定了如何应用这个理论。

In this group of successful investors that I want to consider, there has been a common intellectual patriarch, Ben Graham. But the children who left the house of this intellectual patriarch have called their "flips" in very different ways. They have gone to different places and bought and sold different stocks and companies, yet they have had a combined record that simply cannot be explained by randon chance. It certainly cannot be explained by the fact that they are all calling flips identically because a leader is signaling the calls for them to make. The patriarch has merely set forth the intellectual theory for making coin-calling decisions, but each student has decided on his own manner of applying the theory.

来自格雷汉姆-格雷厄姆和多德斯维尔的投资者的共同智慧主题是：他们寻找企业价值和市场上该企业小部分的价格之间的差异。本质上，他们利用这些差异，而不关心有效市场理论家所关心的股票是在周一还是周四买入，或者是在一月还是七月等。顺便说一句，当商人购买企业时，这正是我们的格雷厄姆和多德投资者通过可市场化股票这种媒介所做的——我怀疑有多少人会把交易发生的星期几或月份纳入他们的购买决策中。如果购买整个企业是在周一还是周五并没有什么区别，我不明白为什么学者们要花费大量的时间和精力来研究购买这些相同企业的小部分是否有区别。我们的格雷厄姆和多德投资者，不用说，不讨论贝塔、资本资产定价模型或证券回报之间的协方差。这些对他们来说都不是感兴趣的话题。事实上，他们中的大多数都很难定义这些术语。投资者只关注两个变量：价格和价值。

The common intellectual theme of the investors from Graham-and-Doddsville is this: they search for discrepancies between the value of a business and the price of small pieces of that business in the market. Essentially, they exploit those discrepancies without the efficient market theorist’s concern as to whether the stocks are bought on Monday or Thursday, or whether it is January or July, etc. Incidentally, when businessmen buy businesses, which is just what our Graham & Dodd investors are doing through the medium of marketable stocks — I doubt that many are cranking into their purchase decision the day of the week or the month in which the transaction is going to occur. If it doesn’t make any difference whether all of a business is being bought on a Monday or a Friday, I am baffled why academicians invest extensive time and effort to see whether it makes a difference when buying small pieces of those same businesses. Our Graham & Dodd investors, needless to say, do not discuss beta, the capital asset pricing model, or covariance in returns among securities. These are not subjects of any interest to them. In fact, most of them would have difficulty defining those terms. The investors simply focus on two variables: price and value.

<br>

我总是觉得很奇怪，有这么多关于价格和成交量行为的研究，这些都是图表分析师的东西。你能想象仅仅因为上周和前一周的业务价格被大幅提高，就去买下一整个企业吗？当然，很多关于这些价格和成交量变量的研究之所以存在，是因为现在，在计算机时代，有关它们的数据几乎是无穷无尽的。这并不一定是因为这些研究有什么用处；只是因为数据就在那里，而学者们努力学习了处理它们所需的数学技能。一旦掌握了这些技能，就好像不使用它们是一种罪过，即使使用它们没有什么用处或者有负面的用处。正如一位朋友说的，对于一个拿着锤子的人来说，所有东西都像钉子。

I always find it extraordinary that so many studies are made of price and volume behavior, the stuff of chartists. Can you imagine buying an entire business simply because the price of the business had been marked up substantially last week and the week before? Of course, the reason a lot of studies are made of these price and volume variables is that now, in the age of computers, there are almost endless data available about them. It isn’t necessarily because such studies have any utility; it’s simply that the data are there and academicians have worked hard to learn the mathematical skills needed to manipulate them. Once these skills are acquired, it seems sinful not to use them, even if the usage has no utility or negative utility. As a friend said, to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

<br>

我认为我们通过一个共同的知识家园来识别的这个群体值得研究。顺便说一句，尽管有很多学术研究关注了价格、成交量、季节性、市值大小等变量对股票表现的影响，但没有人对这个不寻常的以价值为导向的赢家的方法感兴趣。

I think the group that we have identified by a common intellectual home is worthy of study. Incidentally, despite all the academic studies of the influence of such variables as price, volume, seasonality, capitalization size, etc., upon stock performance, no interest has been evidenced in studying the methods of this unusual concentration of value-oriented winners.

<br>

我从1954年到1956年在格雷厄姆-纽曼公司工作的四个人中开始研究这些结果。只有四个人——我没有从成千上万的人中挑选出这些名字。我在上了本·格雷厄姆的课后，主动提出无偿为格雷厄姆-纽曼公司工作，但他拒绝了我，认为我估值过高。他对这个价值的东西非常认真！在我不断地纠缠之下，他终于雇佣了我。公司有三个合伙人和我们四个“平民”级别的员工。我们四个人都在1955年到1957年之间离开了公司，当时公司正在清算，而且可以追踪到其中三个人的记录。

I begin this study of results by going back to a group of four of us who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation from 1954 through 1956. There were only four — I have not selected these names from among thousands. I offered to go to work at Graham-Newman for nothing after I took Ben Graham’s class, but he turned me down as overvalued. He took this value stuff very seriously! After much pestering he finally hired me. There were three partners and four of us at the "peasant" level. All four left between 1955 and 1957 when the firm was wound up, and it’s possible to trace the record of three.

<br>

第一个例子（见表1）是沃尔特·施洛斯的。沃尔特没有上过大学，但是在纽约金融学院晚上上了本·格雷厄姆的课。沃尔特于1955年离开了格雷厄姆-纽曼公司，在28年里取得了这里显示的成绩。这是我告诉他关于沃尔特的情况后，“亚当·史密斯”在《超级货币》（1972）中写的：

The first example (see Table 1) is that of Walter Schloss. Walter never went to college, but took a course from Ben Graham at night at the New York Institute of Finance. Walter left Graham-Newman in 1955 and achieved the record shown here over 28 years. Here is what ‘Adam Smith’ — after I told him about Walter — wrote about him in Supermoney (1972):

<br>

他没有任何关系或有用的信息。华尔街几乎没有人认识他，也没有人给他提供任何想法。他在手册里查看数字，索取年报，就这样而已。

He has no connections or access to useful information. Practically no one in Wall Street knows him and he is not fed any ideas. He looks up the numbers in the manuals and sends for the annual reports, and that’s about it.

<br>

在向我介绍（施洛斯）沃伦时，他在我看来也描述了他自己。‘他从不忘记他是在处理别人的钱，这加强了他对损失的正常强烈厌恶。’他有完全的诚信和对自己的现实认识。钱对他来说是真实的，股票也是真实的——由此产生了对‘安全边际’原则的吸引力。

In introducing me to (Schloss) Warren had also, to my mind, described himself. ‘He never forgets that he is handling other people’s money, and this reinforces his normal strong aversion to loss.’ He has total integrity and a realistic picture of himself. Money is real to him and stocks are real — and from this flows an attraction to the ‘margin of safety’ principle.

<br>

沃尔特拥有非常多样化的投资组合，目前拥有超过100种股票。他知道如何识别那些远低于其对私人所有者的价值的证券。而这就是他所做的一切。他不担心现在是一月份，他不担心现在是星期一，他不担心现在是选举年。他只是说，如果一家公司的价值是一美元，而我可以以40美分的价格买到它，那么我可能会有好运。他一次又一次地这样做。他拥有的股票比我多得多——并且对公司的本质性质也不太感兴趣；我似乎对沃尔特没有太大的影响力。这是他的一个优点；没有人能对他有太大的影响力。

Walter has diversified enormously, owning well over 100 stocks currently. He knows how to identify securities that sell at considerably less than their value to a private owner. And that’s all he does. He doesn’t worry about whether it it’s January, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s Monday, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s an election year. He simply says, if a business is worth a dollar and I can buy it for 40 cents, something good may happen to me. And he does it over and over and over again. He owns many more stocks than I do — and is far less interested in the underlying nature of the business; I don’t seem to have very much influence on Walter. That’s one of his strengths; no one has much influence on him.

*在合伙人运行的过程中产生过超过800次募资，并且在大多数时候至少拥有100个投资头寸，目前管理的资产约为4500万美元。During the history of the Partnership it has owned over 800 issues and, at most times, has had at least 100 positions, Present assets undermanagement approximate $45 million.*

第二个例子是汤姆·纳普，他和我一起在格雷厄姆-纽曼公司工作过。汤姆在战前是普林斯顿大学的化学专业。战后，他成了一个海滩流浪者。有一天，他读到戴维·多德在哥伦比亚大学开设了一门投资学的夜间课程。汤姆以旁听的身份参加了这门课程，他对这门课程产生了极大的兴趣，于是他来到哥伦比亚商学院，获得了MBA学位。他又上了多德的课程，还上了本·格雷厄姆的课程。顺便说一句，35年后，我打电话给汤姆，想确认一些事实，我发现他又在海滩上了。唯一的区别是，现在他拥有了这片海滩！

The second case is Tom Knapp who also worked at Graham-Newman with me. Tom was a chemistry major at Princeton before the war; when he came back from the war, he was a beach bum. And then one day he read that Dave Dodd was giving a night course in investments at Columbia. Tom took it on a noncredit basis, and he got so interested in the subject from taking that course that he came up and enrolled at Columbia Business School, where he got the MBA degree. He took Dodd’s course again, and took Ben Graham’s course. Incidentally, 35 years later I called Tom to ascertain some of the facts involved here and I found him on the beach again. The only difference is that now he owns the beach!

1968年，汤姆·纳普和埃德·安德森，还有另外一两个同样信奉格雷厄姆的人，组成了Tweedy, Browne Partners，他们的投资成果见表2。Tweedy, Browne以非常广泛的多元化建立了这个记录。他们偶尔会买下企业的控制权，但是被动投资的记录和控制投资的记录是一样的。

In 1968, Tom Knapp and Ed Anderson, also a Graham disciple, along with one or two other fellows of similar persuasion, formed Tweedy, Browne Partners, and their investment results appear in Table 2. Tweedy, Browne built that record with very wide diversification. They occasionally bought control of businesses, but the record of the passive investments is equal to the record of the control investments.

表3描述了1957年组建巴菲特合伙公司的第三位成员。他做得最好的事情就是在1969年退出。从那时起，在某种意义上，伯克希尔·哈撒韦就是合伙公司的延续，至少在某些方面是这样。我不能给你一个单一的指标，我觉得这是对伯克希尔投资管理的一个公平的测试。但是我认为无论你怎么算，它都是令人满意的。

Table 3 describes the third member of the group who formed Buffett Partnership in 1957. The best thing he did was to quit in 1969. Since then, in a sense, Berkshire Hathaway has been a continuation of the partnership in some respects. There is no single index I can give you that I would feel would be a fair test of investment management at Berkshire. But I think that any way you figure it, it has been satisfactory.

表4显示了由我在1951年本·格雷厄姆的课堂上认识的一个人管理的Sequoia Fund的记录，他叫比尔·鲁安。他从哈佛商学院毕业后，去了华尔街。然后他意识到他需要得到一份真正的商业教育，所以他来到哥伦比亚大学参加本的课程，我们在1951年初在那里相遇。比尔从1951年到1970年，用相对较小的资金，取得了远高于平均水平的业绩。当我结束巴菲特合伙人公司时，我问比尔是否愿意为我们所有的合伙人设立一个基金，于是他设立了Sequoia Fund。他在一个糟糕的时候设立了这个基金，就在我退出的时候。他直接进入了两层市场和所有给价值导向投资者带来相对表现困难的情况。我很高兴地说，我的合伙人们，在惊人的程度上，不仅留在了他身边，而且还增加了资金，结果如此令人高兴。

Table 4 shows the record of the Sequoia Fund, which is managed by a man whom I met in 1951 in Ben Graham’s class, Bill Ruane. After getting out of Harvard Business School, he went to Wall Street. Then he realized that he needed to get a real business education so he came up to take Ben’s course at Columbia, where we met in early 1951. Bill’s record from 1951 to 1970, working with relatively small sums, was far better than average. When I wound up Buffett Partnership I asked Bill if he would set up a fund to handle all of our partners, so he set up the Sequoia Fund. He set it up at a terrible time, just when I was quitting. He went right into the two-tier market and all the difficulties that made for comparative performance for value-oriented investors. I am happy to say that my partners, to an amazing degree, not only stayed with him but added money, with the happy result shown here.

<br>

并没有什么事后诸葛亮。比尔是我唯一推荐的投资人，我当时的说法是，如果他能年化超过标准普尔4%，就是很好的投资结果了。比尔的收益远超过这个标准，尽管后来的基金净值越来越大，而这也逐渐增大了管理的难度。管理规模会拖收益率的后腿。妥妥的如此。并不是说你没办法在管理大型基金时达到超额收益，只是这样的效果会缩小。试想一下，如果你一旦达到了2万亿美金的规模，而这个数值相当于全美国的经济总价值，你根本没办法超出平均值！

我在这里没有用到后见之明。比尔是我唯一向我的合伙人推荐的人，我当时说，如果他能比标准普尔指数每年高出四个百分点，那就是不错的表现。比尔不仅做到了这一点，而且还在管理着越来越多的资金。这使得事情变得更加困难。规模是业绩的拖累。这是毫无疑问的。这并不意味着你在规模变大后就不能比平均水平做得更好，但是优势会缩小。而且如果你最终管理了两万亿美元的资金，而这恰好是整个经济中所有股票的总市值，那么不要指望你能比平均水平做得更好！

<br>

我应该补充说，在我们迄今为止看过的记录中，在这整个时期里，这些投资组合几乎没有重复。这些都是根据价格和价值之间的差异来选择证券的人，但他们的选择方式非常不同。沃尔特的最大持仓是哈德逊浆纸和杰多高地煤炭和纽约陷阱岩公司等那些即使是对商业版面稍有了解的人也能立刻想起来的名字。Tweedy Browne的选择则沉没到了甚至低于这个水平的名气方面。另一方面，比尔则与大公司合作。这些投资组合之间的重叠非常非常低。这些记录并不反映一个人叫出翻转，然后有五十个人在他后面喊出同样的东西。

I should add that, in the records we’ve looked at so far, throughout this whole period there was practically no duplication in these portfolios. These are men who select securities based on discrepancies between price and value, but they make their selections very differently. Walter’s largest holdings have been such stalwarts as Hudson Pulp & Paper and Jeddo Highland Coal and New York Trap Rock Company and all those other names that come instantly to mind to even a casual reader of the business pages. Tweedy Browne’s selections have sunk even well below that level in terms of name recognition. On the other hand, Bill has worked with big companies. The overlap among these portfolios has been very, very low. These records do not reflect one guy calling the flip and fifty people yelling out the same thing after him.

<br>

表5是我一个朋友的记录，他是哈佛法学院的毕业生，他建立了一个大型的律师事务所。我在1960年左右遇到他，告诉他法律只是一种爱好，但他可以做得更好。他建立了一个与沃尔特完全相反的合伙关系。他的投资组合集中在很少的证券上，因此，他的业绩更加波动，但它是基于同样的价值折扣方法。他愿意接受更大的业绩高低，而且他恰好是一个整个心理都倾向于集中的人，结果如图所示。顺便说一下，这个记录属于查理·芒格，他是我在伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司运营方面的长期合伙人。当他经营自己的合伙关系时，然而，他的投资组合持有几乎完全不同于我和前面提到的其他人。

Table 5 is the record of a friend of mine who is a Harvard Law graduate, who set up a major law firm. I ran into him in about 1960 and told him that law was fine as a hobby but he could do better. He set up a partnership quite the opposite of Walter’s. His portfolio was concentrated in very few securities and therefore, his record was much more volatile but it was based on the same discount-from-value approach. He was willing to accept greater peaks and valleys of performance, and he happens to be a fellow whose whole psyche goes toward concentration, with the results shown. Incidentally, this record belongs to Charlie Munger, my partner for a long time in the operation of Berkshire Hathaway. When he ran his partnership, however, his portfolio holdings were almost completely different from mine and the other fellows mentioned earlier.

表6是查理·芒格的一个朋友的记录——另一种非商学院类型的人——他是南加州大学的数学专业。他毕业后去了IBM工作，一段时间后成了IBM的销售员。我认识了查理，查理认识了他。这是里克·格林的记录。从1965年到1983年，里克以22,200%的复合增长率，击败了标准普尔指数的316%的复合增长率，这可能是因为他缺乏商学院教育，他认为这在统计上是显著的。

Table 6 is the record of a fellow who was a pal of Charlie Munger’s — another non-business school type — who was a math major at USC. He went to work for IBM after graduation and was an IBM salesman for a while. After I got to Charlie, Charlie got to him. This happens to be the record of Rick Guerin. Rick, from 1965 to 1983, against a compounded gain of 316 percent for the S&P, came off with 22,200 percent, which probably because he lacks a business school education, he regards as statistically significant.

我觉得很奇怪，有些人一听到用4毛钱买一块钱的东西，就立刻明白了这个道理，有些人却怎么也不明白。这就像打了预防针一样。如果一开始就没有抓住他们，我发现你可以跟他们说几年，给他们看记录，也没有用。他们似乎无法理解这个概念，尽管它很简单。像Rick Guerin这样的人，虽然没有受过正规的商业教育，但是他立刻就明白了价值投资的方法，并且在五分钟之内就开始运用了。我从来没有见过有人在十年的时间里逐渐转变为这种方法的信徒。这似乎与智商或学术训练无关。要么是一见如故，要么是毫无感觉。

One sidelight here: it is extraordinary to me that the idea of buying dollar bills for 40 cents takes immediately to people or it doesn’t take at all. It’s like an inoculation. If it doesn’t grab a person right away, I find that you can talk to him for years and show him records, and it doesn’t make any difference. They just don’t seem able to grasp the concept, simple as it is. A fellow like Rick Guerin, who had no formal education in business, understands immediately the value approach to investing and he’s applying it five minutes later. I’ve never seen anyone who became a gradual convert over a ten-year period to this approach. It doesn’t seem to be a matter of IQ or academic training. It’s instant recognition, or it is nothing.

表7是斯坦·佩尔米特的记录。斯坦是密歇根大学的文科专业，曾是广告公司Bozell & Jacobs的合伙人。我们碰巧在奥马哈的同一栋楼里。1965年，他发现我比他有更好的生意，于是他离开了广告行业。同样，斯坦只用了五分钟就接受了价值投资的方法。

Table 7 is the record of Stan Perlmeter. Stan was a liberal arts major at the University of Michigan who was a partner in the advertising agency of Bozell & Jacobs. We happened to be in the same building in Omaha. In 1965 he figured out I had a better business than he did, so he left advertising. Again, it took five minutes for Stan to embrace the value approach.

Perlmeter和沃尔特·施洛斯（Walter Schloss）的持仓不一样。他也和比尔·鲁安（Bill Ruane）的持仓不一样。这些都是他们独立创造的记录。但是每次Perlmeter买一支股票，都是因为他花的钱比他得到的价值少。这是他唯一考虑的事情。他不看季度盈利预测，他不看明年的盈利，他不在乎今天是星期几，他不在乎任何地方的投资研究报告，他对价格动量、成交量或者任何其他东西都不感兴趣。他只问一个问题：这个企业值多少钱？

Perlmeter does not own what Walter Schloss owns. He does not own what Bill Ruane owns. These are records made independently. But every time Perlmeter buys a stock it’s because he’s getting more for his money than he’s paying. That’s the only thing he’s thinking about. He’s not looking at quarterly earnings projections, he’s not looking at next year’s earnings, he’s not thinking about what day of the week it is, he doesn’t care what investment research from any place says, he’s not interested in price momentum, volume, or anything. He’s simply asking: What is the business worth?

表8和表9是我参与的两个养老基金的记录。它们不是从我参与的数十个养老基金中挑选出来的；它们是我唯一有影响力的两个。在这两种情况下，我都建议他们选择以价值为导向的管理者。非常非常少的养老基金是从价值的角度来管理的。表8是华盛顿邮报公司的养老基金。它以前是一个大银行，我建议他们最好选择一些有价值取向的管理者。

Table 8 and Table 9 are the records of two pension funds I’ve been involved in. They are not selected from dozens of pension funds with which I have had involvement; they are the only two I have influenced. In both cases I have steered them toward value-oriented managers. Very, very few pension funds are managed from a value standpoint. Table 8 is the Washington Post Company’s Pension Fund. It was with a large bank some years ago, and I suggested that they would do well to select managers who had a value orientation.

你可以看到，自从他们做出改变以来，他们一直处于最高百分位。邮报告诉经理们，至少要把这些基金的25%放在债券上，这可能不是这些经理们的选择。所以，我把债券的表现也包括进来，只是为了说明，这个团队对债券没有什么特别的专长。他们也不会说他们有。即使有这样一个拖累，即他们的基金中有25%的部分在一个不是他们擅长的领域，他们仍然处于基金管理的最高百分位。华盛顿邮报的经验并没有涵盖一个很长的时期，但它确实代表了三位经理做出的许多投资决策，而这些经理并不是事后才被确定的。

As you can see, overall they have been in the top percentile ever since they made the change. The Post told the managers to keep at least 25 percent of these funds in bonds, which would not have been necessarily the choice of these managers. So, I’ve included the bond performance simply to illustrate that this group has no particular expertise about bonds. They wouldn’t have said they did. Even with this drag of 25 percent of their fund in an area that was not their game, they were in the top percentile of fund management. The Washington Post experience does not cover a terribly long period but it does represent many investment decisions by three managers who were not identified retroactively.

表9是FMC公司基金的记录。我自己没有管理过它的一分钱，但是在1974年，我影响了他们选择价值导向的管理者的决定。在那之前，他们选择管理者的方式和大多数大公司差不多。他们现在在贝克调查中排名第一，这是一个针对他们这个规模的养老金基金在这段时间后转向价值方法的调查。去年他们有八个股权管理者，任期超过一年。其中七个的累计业绩都比标准普尔指数好。所有八个去年的业绩都比标准普尔指数好。现在，中等业绩和FMC基金在这段时间内的实际业绩之间的净差额是2.43亿美元。FMC将这归功于他们在选择管理者时给予他们的思维方式。这些管理者不一定是我会选择的管理者，但是他们有一个共同点，就是根据价值选择证券。

Table 9 is the record of the FMC Corporation fund. I don’t manage a dime of it myself but I did, in 1974, influence their decision to select value-oriented managers. Prior to that time they had selected managers much the same way as most larger companies. They now rank number one in the Becker survey of pension funds for their size over the period of time subsequent to this “conversion” to the value approach. Last year they had eight equity managers of any duration beyond a year. Seven of them had a cumulative record better than the S&P. All eight had a better record last year than the S&P. The net difference now between a median performance and the actual performance of the FMC fund over this period is $243 million. FMC attributes this to the mindset given to them about the selection of managers. Those managers are not the managers I would necessarily select but they have the common denominators of selecting securities based on value.

<br>

这些是格雷厄姆和多德斯维尔的“掷硬币者”的九条记录。我没有从成千上万的人中回顾性地挑选他们。这不像我在向你背诵一群彩票中奖者的名字——他们是我在他们中奖之前从未听说过的人。我是根据他们的投资决策框架在多年前选择了这些人。我知道他们学到了什么，另外，我对他们的智力、品格和气质也有一些个人了解。要明白，这个群体承担的风险远低于平均水平；注意他们在整体市场疲软的年份的表现。虽然他们在风格上有很大的不同，但这些投资者在心理上总是在买入企业，而不是买入股票。他们中的一些人有时会买下整个企业，但更多时候，他们只是买下企业的一小部分。无论是买下全部还是一小部分企业，他们的态度都是一样的。他们中有些人持有数十只股票的投资组合；另一些人则集中于少数几只。但他们都利用了企业的市场价值和内在价值之间的差异。

So these are nine records of “coin-flippers” from Graham-and-Doddsville. I haven’t selected them with hindsight from among thousands. It’s not like I am reciting to you the names of a bunch of lottery winners — people I had never heard of before they won the lottery. I selected these men years ago based upon their framework for investment decision-making. I knew what they had been taught and additionally I had some personal knowledge of their intellect, character, and temperament. It’s very important to understand that this group has assumed far less risk than average; note their record in years when the general market was weak. While they differ greatly in style, these investors are, mentally, always buying the business, not buying the stock. A few of them sometimes buy whole businesses far more often they simply buy small pieces of businesses. Their attitude, whether buying all or a tiny piece of a business, is the same. Some of them hold portfolios with dozens of stocks; others concentrate on a handful. But all exploit the difference between the market price of a business and its intrinsic value.

<br>

我相信市场上存在着很多低效率。这些格雷厄姆和多德维尔的投资者成功地利用了价格和价值之间的差距。当一只股票的价格可以受到华尔街“羊群”的影响，而价格又是由最情绪化的人、最贪婪的人或最沮丧的人在边际上决定的时候，很难说市场总是理性定价的。事实上，市场价格经常是荒谬的。

I’m convinced that there is much inefficiency in the market. These Graham-and-Doddsville investors have successfully exploited gaps between price and value. When the price of a stock can be influenced by a “herd” on Wall Street with prices set at the margin by the most emotional person, or the greediest person, or the most depressed person, it is hard to argue that the market always prices rationally. In fact, market prices are frequently nonsensical.

<br>

我想说一件关于风险和回报的重要事情。有时风险和回报之间存在正相关。如果有人对我说，“我这里有一把六发手枪，我已经把一颗子弹装进去了。你为什么不转一转然后扣一下扳机呢？如果你活下来，我会给你100万美元。”我会拒绝——也许会说100万美元不够多。然后他可能会提议我扣两下扳机，给我500万美元——这就是风险和回报之间的正相关！

I would like to say one important thing about risk and reward. Sometimes risk and reward are correlated in a positive fashion. If someone were to say to me, “I have here a six-shooter and I have slipped one cartridge into it. Why don’t you just spin it and pull it once? If you survive, I will give you $1 million.” I would decline — perhaps stating that $1 million is not enough. Then he might offer me $5 million to pull the trigger twice — now that would be a positive correlation between risk and reward!

<br>

价值投资恰恰相反。如果你用60美分买一美元，风险比你用40美分买一美元要大，但后者的回报期望更高。价值投资组合的回报潜力越大，风险就越小。

The exact opposite is true with value investing. If you buy a dollar bill for 60 cents, it’s riskier than if you buy a dollar bill for 40 cents, but the expectation of reward is greater in the latter case. The greater the potential for reward in the value portfolio, the less risk there is.

<br>

一个简单的例子：1973年，华盛顿邮报公司在市场上的售价是8000万美元。那天，你可以把它的资产卖给任何一个买家，不低于4亿美元，甚至可能更多。该公司拥有邮报、新闻周刊，以及几个主要市场的电视台。现在，这些财产的价值是20亿美元，所以那个愿意出4亿美元的人也不算疯了。

One quick example: The Washington Post Company in 1973 was selling for $80 million in the market. At the time, that day, you could have sold the assets to any one of ten buyers for not less than $400 million, probably appreciably more. The company owned the Post, Newsweek, plus several television stations in major markets. Those same properties are worth $2 billion now, so the person who would have paid $400 million would not have been crazy.

<br>

现在，如果这只股票的价格进一步下跌，使得它的估值从8000万美元降到4000万美元，它的贝塔系数就会更高。而对于那些认为贝塔系数衡量风险的人来说，更低的价格会让它看起来更有风险。这真是令人难以置信。我从来不明白，为什么以4000万美元买入价值4亿美元的资产比以8000万美元买入更有风险。而且，事实上，如果你买入一组这样的证券，并且对商业估值有一定的了解，以4000万美元买入价值4亿美元的资产是几乎没有风险的，特别是如果你是通过买入十个价值4000万美元的、每个包含800万美元现金的资产堆。由于你没有掌握这4亿美元，你要确保你和诚实、能力相当的人合作，但这并不是一件难事。

Now, if the stock had declined even further to a price that made the valuation $40 million instead of $80 million, its beta would have been greater. And to people that think beta measures risk, the cheaper price would have made it look riskier. This is truly Alice in Wonderland. I have never been able to figure out why it’s riskier to buy $400 million worth of properties for $40 million than $80 million. And, as a matter of fact, if you buy a group of such securities and you know anything at all about business valuation, there is essentially no risk in buying $400 million for $80 million, particularly if you do it by buying ten $40 million piles of $8 million each. Since you don’t have your hands on the $400 million, you want to be sure you are in with honest and reasonably competent people, but that’s not a difficult job.

<br>

你还必须有足够的知识，让你能够对底层企业的价值做出一个大致的估计。但你不要把它做得太精确。这就是本·格雷厄姆所说的保证安全边际。你不要试图用8000万美元买下价值8300万美元的企业。你要给自己留下一个巨大的空间。当你建造一座桥梁时，你要确保它能承受3万磅的重量，但你只开1万磅的卡车过桥。这个原则在投资中也同样适用。

You also have to have the knowledge to enable you to make a very general estimate about the value of the underlying businesses. But you do not cut it close. That is what Ben Graham meant by having a margin of safety. You don’t try and buy businesses worth $83 million for $80 million. You leave yourself an enormous margin. When you build a bridge, you insist it can carry 30,000 pounds, but you only drive 10,000 pound trucks across it. And that same principle works in investing.

<br>

最后，你们中一些更有商业头脑的人可能会想，我为什么要写这篇文章。让更多的人转向价值投资，必然会缩小价格和价值之间的差距。我只能告诉你们，这个秘密已经公开了50年，自从本·格雷厄姆和戴维·多德写了《证券分析》以来，我在过去的35年里从事价值投资，却没有看到这种趋势。似乎有一种扭曲的人类特性，喜欢把简单的事情搞复杂。如果说有什么变化的话，学术界在过去的30年里，反而从教授价值投资中退缩了。这种情况可能会继续下去。船只会绕着地球航行，但是“地球是平的”协会会兴旺发达。市场上价格和价值之间的差距会继续存在，那些阅读过格雷厄姆和多德的人会继续获利。

In conclusion, some of the more commercially minded among you may wonder why I am writing this article. Adding many converts to the value approach will perforce narrow the spreads between price and value. I can only tell you that the secret has been out for 50 years, ever since Ben Graham and Dave Dodd wrote Security Analysis, yet I have seen no trend toward value investing in the 35 years that I’ve practiced it. There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult. The academic world, if anything, has actually backed away from the teaching of value investing over the last 30 years. It’s likely to continue that way. Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace, and those who read their Graham & Dodd will continue to prosper.

title: 巴菲特：一本简明英语手册 序言 A Plain English Handbook Preface
date: 1997-01-13

<p class="small">时间：1997年1月13日</p>
<p class="small">来源：[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/pdf/handbook.pdf)</p>
<p class="small">原文标题：A Plain English 
Handbook Preface </p>

<br>

这本手册，以及莱维特主席推动披露文件使用“简明英语”的整个行动，对我来说是个好消息。四十多年来，我一直在研究上市公司提交的文件。很多时候，我无法理解他们到底在说什么，或者更糟糕的是，不得不得出他们什么也没说的结论。如果公司律师和他们的客户遵循这本手册的建议，我的生活会变得容易得多。

This handbook, and Chairman Levitt’s whole drive to encourage “plain English” in disclosure documents, are good news for me. For more than forty years, I’ve studied the documents that public companies file. Too often, I’ve been unable to decipher just what is being said or, worse yet, had to conclude that nothing was being said. If corporate lawyers and their clients follow the advice in this handbook, my life is going to become much easier.

<br>

有几种可能的解释，为什么我和其他人有时会对一个会计注释或债券说明感到困惑。也许我们只是没有足够的专业知识来理解作者想要传达的内容。或者也许作者自己也不明白他或她在说什么。在某些情况下，我怀疑一个不太诚实的发行人并不希望我们理解他或她觉得有法律义务提及的主题。

There are several possible explanations as to why I and others some­ times stumble over an accounting note or indenture description. Maybe we simply don’t have the technical knowledge to grasp what the writer wishes to convey. Or perhaps the writer doesn’t understand what he or she is talking about. In some cases, moreover, I suspect that a less-than­ scrupulous issuer doesn’t want us to understand a subject it feels legally obligated to touch upon.

<br>

也许最常见的问题是，一个善意而有见识的作者无法把信息传达给一个聪明而感兴趣的读者。在这种情况下，生硬的行话和复杂的结构通常是罪魁祸首。

Perhaps the most common problem, however, is that a well-intentioned and informed writer simply fails to get the message across to an intelligent, interested reader. In that case, stilted jargon and complex constructions are usually the villains.

<br>

这本手册告诉你如何摆脱那些阻碍有效沟通的障碍。按照这本手册的指示写作，你会惊讶地发现你的读者会认为你变得更聪明了。

This handbook tells you how to free yourself of those impediments to effective communication. Write as this handbook instructs you and you will be amazed at how much smarter your readers will think you have become.

<br>

一个不新鲜但有用的建议：写作时要有一个特定的对象在心中。当我写伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司的年度报告时，我假装我在跟我的姐妹们说话。我很容易想象他们：虽然他们非常聪明，但他们不是会计或金融方面的专家。他们能理解简单的英语，但行话可能会让他们困惑。我的目标很简单，就是给他们提供我希望他们在我们的位置互换时提供给我的信息。要成功，我不需要成为莎士比亚；我必须有一个真诚地想要传达信息的愿望。

One unoriginal but useful tip: Write with a specific person in mind. When writing Berkshire Hathaway’s annual report, I pretend that I’m talking to my sisters. I have no trouble picturing them: Though highly intelligent, they are not experts in accounting or finance. They will understand plain English, but jargon may puzzle them. My goal is simply to give them the information I would wish them to supply me if our positions were reversed. To succeed, I don’t need to be Shakespeare; I must, though, have a sincere desire to inform.

<br>

没有兄弟姐妹可以写信给吗？借我的吧：只要以“亲爱的多丽丝和伯蒂”开头。

No siblings to write to? Borrow mine: Just begin with “Dear Doris and Bertie.”

### 开场白（0:00 – 1:00）

（测试麦克风）测试，一百万？两百万？三百万？看起来没问题了。

Testing, One million? two million? three million? seems to be working.

<br>

我打算就简短的讲几句，然后主要的是几分钟之后的问答环节。因为我想回答一些你们想知道的事情。我恳请你们给我出难题，因为这样对我来说带难度的问题更有意思（巴菲特在这里做了一个棒球的比喻，如果在投出的时候带点速度，可以投出弧线，这样作为击球手将更难命中）。你可以问除了上周德克萨斯A&M比赛以外的任何问题，这就是全部的要求了。

I would like to just say a few words momentarily and then the highlight for me will be getting your questions in a few minutes. Because I want to talk about what is on your mind. I urge you to throw hard balls. It's more fun for me if you put a little bit speed on your pitch as they come in. You can ask about everything excepts last week's TexasA&M game. That's all the limits.

<br>

在座的有些是来自太阳信托银行的人。我刚刚从一个可口可乐的会议中结束。我坐在吉米・威廉姆斯的旁边，他在那里已经工作了好几年了。他想确认我当我来这里的时候穿着这件太阳信托银行的T恤。我曾经想从老年高尔夫巡回赛中获得赞助但我一直缺乏运气。但是这次我在投行“巡回赛”中的表现倒是好些了。他说我的报酬是若干个几个百分点的来自银行存款的收益。我决定将从此为“太阳信托银行队”效力，成为太阳信托银行队的0号队员。

We have a couple of men here from SunTrust. I just came from a Cock meeting. I sat next to Jimmy Williams, he has been there for many years. He wanted to be sure that I wore this SunTrust shirt down here. I tried to get sponsorships from the senior golf tour but I ain't have much luck. But now I’m at the banker's tour I'm doing a little bit better than that. He said that I got a few percentage of increase of deposits gains from it. I will all go out for SunTrust. Zero SunTrust.

<br>

### 品质比智慧和努力更重要（1:00 – 6:40）

我想用个一分钟和学生们谈谈在你们离开这大学后的将来。因为你们将会学到许多投资的知识并且能够做得足够好。你们都有足够的智商做好。你们都有足够的积极性和能量去做好。否则你们不会在这了。你们中的大部分都能实现你们的抱负。但是，在决定是否你们能成功，有一个比智力和能量更重要的东西。我只想用点时间谈谈这一点。实际上，有一个在奥马哈的伙计，皮特・基威特（财富美国500强企业，基威特公司的创始人），曾经说过：“我们在雇佣的时候看中三点。我们寻找那些正直，聪明，富有能量的人。”然后他说：“对于那些没有前两点的人，只有后两点的人会害了他们的。因为如果他们不够正直，你希望他们又蠢又懒，你不希望他们聪明而富有能量。”（学生大笑）

Warren Buffett: I would like to talk for just one minute to the students about your future when you leave here. Because there is…you’re gonna learn a tremendous amount about investments and you will learn enough to do well. You all have got the IQ to do well. You all have got the initiatives and energy to do well. Or you wouldn’t be here. Most of you will succeed in meeting your aspiration. But, in determining whether you will succeed, there is more to it than intellect and energy. I’d like to talk for just a second about that. In fact, there was a fellow, Pete Kiewit, in Omaha, used to say that: “We look for three things in hiring people. We look for integrity, intelligence, and energy.” And he said that: “The person didn’t have the first two, the latter two will kill them. Because if they don’t have integrity, you want them to be dumb and lazy, you don’t want them to be smart and energetic.” 

<br>

我认为我应该好好谈谈第一点，因为我们知道你们拥有后两点。花点时间和我玩一个小小的游戏吧。我们都在这待了，我猜，MBA的第二学年的一大半了，对你的同学也足够了解了。花点时间想想，假如我给你一个购买你的某一个同学的未来人生10%的机会 —— 你不能选爸爸最富的那个同学，那不算数（学生大笑）—— 你必须选那个能靠自己的本事做事情的人。我会给你一个小时去思考这个问题。在你的同学中你选谁，那个你愿意拥有10%未来人生的那个人？你会让每个人都做个IQ测试然后选那个最聪明的？我不觉得。你会选择那个成绩最好的？我不觉得。你也不太可能选那个最富有能量的那个，因为你们都是非常富有能量的人。

I thought I really like to talk about that first one, because we know you have got the second two. Play along with me in a little game for just a second in terms of thinking about that question. We have all been here, I guess, almost all of your second year MBA and got to know your classmate. Think for a moment that I granted you the right to buy 10% of one of your classmates for the rest of his or her lifetime – you can’t pick one with the richest father, that doesn’t count – you got to pick them…somebody who is going to do it on their own merit. I will give you an hour to think about it. Which one are you going to pick among all of your classmates, the one that you want to own 10% for the rest of life time? Are you going to give them an IQ test? Pick the one with the highest IQ? I doubt it. Are you going to pick the one with the best grade? Er…I doubt it. You ain’t going to pick the most energetic one, necessarily, you have been the one who display the most initiatives. 

<br>

你们会开始寻找一些定性的因素。因为每个人都足够好的大脑，也富有能量。我会说如果你真的花了一个小时想了这个问题，考虑好你打算赌在谁身上，你可能会选一个你最合得来的人。那个有着领袖特质的人。那个帮别人实现他们的想法的人。那个慷慨的，诚实的，而且不会和抢着和别人邀功的人，即使私下那其实是他们自己的想法。各种像这样的品质。你可以写下那些你在别人身上发现让你欣赏的品质，那些你在班上最敬佩的人。

You are going to start looking for qualitative factors, in additions. Because everybody have got good brain here and are energetic. I would say if you have thought about it for an hour and have decided who you are going to place your bet on, you probably picked the one who you responded the best to. The one who is going to have the leadership qualities. The one who is going to get other people to carry out their interest. That would be the person who is generous, honest, and give credits to other people even if those was their own ideas. All kinds of qualities like that. You could write down those qualities that you admire in these other persons, whoever you admire the most in the class. 

<br>

然后我会给你们添乱，我会说：“在你能买别人10%的同时，你也可以做空某个人未来的10%。”（学生大笑）这更有意思了，不是吗？然后你就会想，“我该做空谁呢？”同样的，你不会选那个IQ最低的，你会开始思考那些，因为某些原因，让你看不惯的那些人。他们有着各类的品质，和学术上无关的那些。但是这些品质，本质上，让你并不想和他们相处。其实其他人也不愿意和他们相处。那这些品质是哪些呢？这些品质有一堆。那可以是某个人的自大，某个人的贪婪，某个人的不诚实，投机取巧。这类的品质。你可以把这些品质写在一张纸的右边。

And then, I would throw in a hooker, I would say: “As part of owning 10% of this person, you have to really go short 10% of somebody else in this class. That’s more fun, isn’t it? Then you will think: “Who am I want to go short of?” Again, you wouldn’t pick the person with the lowest IQ, or… You will start thinking about the person, really, who had turned you off for one reason or another. They have various qualities, quite apart from their academic achievements. But they have various qualities, in the end, you really don’t want to be around with them. And other people don’t want to be around with them. What will the qualities that lead to that? That would be a whole bunch of things. It’s the person who is egotistic. Or it’s the person who is greedy. Or it’s the person who is slightly dishonest and cuts corners. All of these qualities. You can write those down on the right-hand side of the page. 

<br>

当你看到纸上左边和右边这些品质，你会发现一个有意思的一点。这些和能把橄榄球扔60 码无关，也和能在9.3秒跑完100码无关，也和长得最好看无关。这些在纸的左边，都是那些如果你想要就能拥有的。我的意思是，它们都是每个人可以做到的行为，性情，品格。并不是说你们中的有些人不可能拥有这些。你再看看纸的右边，那些你在别人身上发现的让你不喜欢的品质，其实也不是你必须有的品质。如果你有，你可以改掉的。在你们这个年龄改起来比我这个年龄容易多了。因为大部分的行为都是习惯。人们说：“习惯的锁链轻的难易察觉，直到重的难以挣脱。”这句话是对的。我看到人们在我这个年龄，或者比我小上10,20岁，有着自毁性的行为习惯。他们已经陷在其中了。他们做着各种各样让人们难以接受的事情。他们没必要这样，但是在某个时刻，这个习惯已经几乎改不掉了。但是在你们这个年龄你们可以拥有任何你想要的习惯，任何行为模式。

When you look at that…oops…(the microphone is slipping off the podium, and Warren catches it and put it aside) I don’t know which one I’m going to use…can you hear me? Ok with this? Fine…What am I going to do with it (someone is telling Warren to use the microphone attached on his belt)? Oh, it just came loose? Ok. You can see why I avoid technology. Chewing gum is about as far as I get. As you look at those qualities on the right and left hand side, there is one interesting thing about them. It’s not the ability to throw football 60 yards. It’s not the quality to run a 100-yard dash in 9.3. it’s not being the best-looking person in the class. They are all qualities that if you really want to have, the ones on the left-hand side, you can have them. I mean, they are qualities of behaviors, temperaments, characters that are achievable. They are not forbidden to anybody in this group. If you look at the qualities on the right-hand side, the ones that you find turn you off in other people, there is not a quality there that you have to have. If you have them you can…you can get rid of it. You can get rid of them a lot easier in your age than you can in my age. Because most behaviors is habitual. They say: “The chain of habits is too light to be felt, until they are too heavy to be broken.” There is no question about that. I see people with these self-destructive behavior patterns at my age or even 10 or 20 years younger. They really are entrapped by that. They go around and do things that turn off other people right and left. They don’t need to be that way but by a certain point they get so they can hardly change it. But at your age you can have any habits, any patterns of behavior, that you wish. It’s simply a question of which you decide and want to decide the ones that…I mean…if you like. 

<br>

本・格雷厄姆，或者更早的，本・富兰克林做过这样的事。本・格雷厄姆在他只有10来岁的时候，四处观察，看了看他钦佩的那些人，然后想：“我也想被人钦佩，所以为何我不学着像他们那样？”他发现这并没有什么不可能。同样的，对于那些他想摆脱的品质，他也做了类似的事情。

Ben Graham did this…Ben Franklin did this before him. Ben Graham in his low teens…looked around…he looked at the people who he admired and he said, you know, “I want to be admire, so why don’t I just behave like them?” He found that there is nothing impossible about behaving like them. Similarly, he did the same thing on the reverse side in terms of getting rid of those qualities. 

<br>

我建议如果你写下了你喜欢的品质并且思考过。那就让纸上的这些成为你们的习惯。你最后会成为那个在以后你想买下未来10%的人。事实的美好之处在于，你已经拥有了自己的100%，这是已经确定的。你干脆就让这些品质集中在自己身上好了。

I would suggest that if you write those qualities down and think about them a little while. Make them habitual. You will be the one that you want to buy 10 percent when you get old. The beauty is you have already own 100% of you and you are stuck with it. You might as well be that person as oppose to somebody else.

### 投资日本：寻找绩优股而不是廉价股（6:40 - 9:40）

沃伦巴菲特：这是一点简短的说教。来谈谈你们感兴趣的话题吧。像我之前说的，你可以问任何问题。我不知道因此会发生什么。不过，让我们从这里或者那里举起的手来开始（问答）吧。从哪里开始好？好，就你吧！

Warren Buffett: That’s a short little sermon. Let’s get on to what you are interested in. Like I said, you can go all over the lot. I don’t know exactly how we are going to handle this. But, let’s starts with the hand in somewhere or the other. Where should we go? Yeah right here!

<br>

学生：你对日本的看法？

Student: Your thought about Japan?

<br>

沃伦巴菲特：我对日本的看法？我不是一个宏观的人（译者注：巴菲特很少做宏观经济分析）。我对自己说：“伯克希尔哈撒韦现在在日本贷款10年只需要1%的利率。”1%。然后我对自己说：“天…45年前我上过格雷厄姆的课。并且我已经为此努力工作了45年。也许我可以赚高于1%的回报率！如果我足够认真的话。”（学生大笑）一年1%，并不是不可能，不是吗？因为我不想牵扯汇率风险，所以我只能在日元计价的东西上投资。我要做的就是在日本房地产，日本商业，或者某些类似的东西中选择。我要做的就是比1%好。这是我的全部成本。对我来说在十年内做到这一点并不难。但目前为止我什么机会都没找到（学生大笑）。

Warren Buffett: My thought about Japan? I’m not a “micro” guy. I say to myself: “Berkshire Hathaway can borrow money for ten years at 1% in Japan now.”1%. And I say to myself: “Gee… I took Graham’s class 45 years ago. I’m been working hard on this thing all my life. Maybe I can earn more than 1%! If I really work hard at it!”1% a year, doesn’t seem impossible, does it? I wouldn’t want to get involved in currency risk so I have to do with something that is Yen-denominated. So I have to be in Japanese real estate, or Japanese business, or something of the sort. All I have to do is to beat 1%. That’s all the money gonna cost me. I can get it for ten years. So far I haven’t found anything.

<br>

这应该很有趣了。日本公司的权益回报率都很低。他们中的有一些公司的权益回报率是4,5,6%。当你在一个回报率不怎么高的公司里成为一个投资者非常难赚很多钱。不过有的人能做到。实际上，我有一个曾经和我一起为格雷厄姆工作的朋友，沃尔特・施洛斯能做到。那是一种我最初面对股票的做法：买价格比营运资金低得多的股票。量化层面上的便宜股票。我称之为“雪茄烟蒂投资法”。你走在街上，四处寻找某处存在的烟蒂。找了一段时间你终于找到了一个，已经浸水了，蛮令人反胃的，但还能吸上一口。所以你捡起来。吸的这一口是免费的！我的意思是这是一个烟蒂股。你得到了那免费的一口烟，扔掉，然后继续在街上行走试着寻找下一个（学生大笑）。我的意思是这并不优雅但确实可行（学生大笑）。如果你找的是免费的一口烟，这能行的通！这些都是低回报率公司。但是时间是绩优的公司的朋友也是糟糕公司的敌人。如果你长期待在糟糕公司里，你能得到的结果也是糟糕的，尽管你可能买入时的价格低廉。如果你在一个绩优的公司待上很长一段时间，即使你当时支付了有些高的价格，你会得到优良的结果，如果你愿意在那儿停留一长段时间。

It’s gotta be interesting. Japanese companies earn very low returns on equity. They have a bunch of businesses that earn 4，5，6% on equity. It’s very hard to earn a lot as an investor when the business you are in doesn’t make very much money. Some people do it. In fact, I got a friend, Walter Schloss, who worked with Graham at the same time I did. It was the first way I went at stocks: to buy stocks selling way below working capital. Very cheap quantitatively stocks. I call it “the cigar butt approach to investing”. You walk down the street and look around for cigar butts some place. You finally see one and its soggy and kind of repulsive, but there is one puff left in it. So you pick it up. The puff is free! I mean it is a cigar butt stock. You got one free puff out of it and you throw it away and walk down the street trying to find another one. I mean it’s not elegant but it works. If you are looking for a free puff, it works! Those were low return businesses. But time is the friend of a wonderful business and is the enemy of a lousy business. If you are in a lousy business for a long time, you gonna get a lousy result, even if you buy it cheap. If you are in a wonderful business for a long time, even if you paid a little bit too much going in, you gonna get a wonderful result if you stay in it for a long time. 

<br>

我当今…现在…找到的绩优的日本公司非常少。他们可能会在某个方面改变这种文化，于是管理层能够接受更多的股东反馈。这样回报率可能会高一些。但是当今你能找到非常…很多…低回报公司。在日本经济腾飞的那段时间这个情况依然存在。这很奇怪了：他们有着了不起的市场但没有了不起的公司。他们在做各类生意都很了不起，但他们在权益回报率上并没有了不起。这最终伤害了他们。所以到目前为止我们（伯克希尔哈撒韦）什么都没做。但是只要钱只需1%我会一直找机会的（学生大笑）。

I find a very few wonderful businesses in Japan at present…now. They may change the culture in some way so the management gets more stockholder responses over there. The returns may be higher. But at present time you will find a very…lots of…low return businesses. That’s true even when the Japanese economy was booming. It’s amazing: they had an incredible market without incredible companies. They were incredible in terms of doing a lot of businesses but they weren’t incredible in terms of the return on equity they had achieved. That has finally caught up with them. So we have so far done nothing there. But as long as money is 1% I will keep looking.

<br>

### 长期资本管理公司的失败案例：金钱重要，重要的是从事自己热爱的工作（9:40 – 21:15）

巴菲特：好的!（巴菲特点名让学生提问）

Warren: Yeah! (Buffett lets one of student audience to ask a question).

<br>

学生：有传言你是长期资本管理公司其中的一个救市者。具体是发生了什么事？你的看法是什么？

Student: You were rumored to be one of the rescue buyers of Long Term Capital Management. What was the play there? What did you see?

<br>

巴菲特：好吧在财富杂志有一个完整的故事，封面有鲁伯特・默多克的那一期，讲述了我们参与的全部细节。那是一个有意思的故事…那是一个很长的故事所以我不打算全部叙述了。我当时接到了一个非常紧急的电话，关于长期资本管理公司，大概是4周前的这个周五…无所谓了（巴菲特不太记得细节了）。那时我的曾女…当时是下午3点左右…我的曾女准备在那天晚上举办一个生日派对。而我当晚准备去西雅图和盖茨一起出发去一个在阿拉斯加为期12天的假期…搭乘私人飞机…等等一类的事情。我当时几乎没有办法和外界联系。那个周五的下午我接到一个电话说（长期资本管理公司的）事情真的很严重了。我在这个（财富杂志的）那篇文章出来之前的几个周前接到一些别的电话过。（长期资本管理公司的）我都认识，大部分人我都很了解。在我还在所罗门的时候，大部分人都在所罗门兄弟工作。

Buffett: well there’s a story in the current Fortune magazine, the one has Rupert Murdoch’s picture on the cover that tells the whole story of our involvement. It’s kind of interesting story because… it’s a long story so I won’t go into all the background of it. But I got the really serious call about Long Term Capital about four weeks ago this Friday… whenever it was. It was my granddaughter…I got there in midafternoon… my granddaughter was having her birthday party that evening and then I was flying that night to Seattle to go on a 12-day trip with Gates to Alaska…on a private plane…all kinds of things. I was really out of communication. But I got this call on a Friday afternoon saying things were really getting serious there. I had some other calls before that article gets into…a few weeks earlier. I know those people – most of them – pretty well. A lot of them were in Solomon when I was there.

<br>

（长期资本管理公司的）股价在崩溃，而美联储在周末不停的派人去处理。在那个周五和下个周三之间，纽约美联储实质上是促成了一个救市举动，尽管没有政府的资本参与。我当时在积极相应但是过程并不轻松，因为我们正在峡谷间航行，这对在阿拉斯加的我来说并没啥有趣的。船长当时正在说：“你们知道吗，如果我们待在这里，我们可能能见到一些北极熊和鲸鱼”我说：“待在良好卫星信号的地方吧！” （学生大笑）当时的我背对着所有景色，打着电话。整群人都认为我的举动很滑稽。

The price was imploding and the Fed was sending people up that weekend. Between that Friday and the following Wednesday, when the New York Fed in effect orchestrated a rescue effort but without any federal money involved. I was quite active but I was having this terrible time because we were sailing up through these canyons which were of no interest for me whatsoever in Alaska. The captain would say: “you know, if we just stay over here we might see some bears and wales.“  I said: “stay where you got a good satellite connection!” That was the picture. Unfortunately, I got all things going off all behind me and I got my back to it – I’m on a phone which was – the people, the group – they find it funny the way I’m working on the phone. 

<br>

周三早上我们提交了买入请求。在那个时候我在蒙大拿州博兹曼市，我和比尔・麦克多诺，纽约美联储主席，谈了话。那天纽约早上时间10点还在和银行家们开会。实际上，当我还在怀俄明他给我打电话的时候，我们在纽约早上时间10点前传达了信息。我们提交了买入请求。因为是距离遥远，所以提出的一切都是一个简单的纲要。最后我们提出为净资产支付2.5亿。我们本来是会再支付大约30到32.5亿的。这样的话就是30亿来自伯克希尔哈撒韦，7亿来自美国国际集团，3亿来自高盛。我们提交买入请求但要求很快就会撤回。因为你实际上是在为价值千亿但并价格不稳定的证券买单。所以你不会想去为这个并不稳定的资产支付一个固定的价格，何况我们还担心会被人做空。在最后银行家们促成了交易，那是一段有趣的时期。

We put in a bid on Wednesday morning. By then I was in Bozeman, Montana, I talked to Bill McDonough, the head of New York Fed by 10 o’clock. They were having a meeting with bankers at 10 o’clock that morning in New York. We called them…we actually delivered the message when he called me out there in Wyoming a little bit before 10, New York time. We made a bid. Because it was being done in a long distance, everything was really the outline of a bid. In the end, I was in a bid for 250 million essentially for the net assets. We would have put in three or three-quarters billion on top of that. It would have been three billion from Berkshire Hathaway 700 million from AIG and 300 million from Goldman Sachs. We submitted that but with a very short time limit with that. Because when you’re bidding on hundred-billion-dollar worth of securities that are moving around. You don’t wanna leave a fixed price bid out there very long plus we were worried about it would be getting shorted. In the end the bankers made the deal. It was an interesting period.

<br>

整个长期资本管理公司，我希望你们了解，整个的故事非常惊奇。如果你考虑到约翰・梅里韦瑟，埃里克・罗森费尔德，拉里・西利布兰，格雷格・霍金斯，维克托・黑格尼，那两个诺贝尔得主默顿和斯克尔斯，如果你考虑到那16个人，他们大概是有着国内最高的平均IQ的16人企业团队，比微软或者是其他任何一个美国企业都好。惊人的高智商人群。然后你再考虑一个事实，那16人有着丰富的从业经验。那些人不是以前干男士服装销售然后突然再转行做证券的生意的。他们有，16人共计，大概350年到400年历史的经验，过去就已经在从事现在在做的事情了。然后你再考虑到第三个因素，大部分人将他们几乎所有的净值都投入了这个公司，所以他们自己的钱也在里面，几亿几亿的钱。超高智商人群，从事熟知的行业，然后基本就破产了。这件事对我来说简直惊奇。

The whole Long Term Capital Management, I hope most of you are familiar with it, the whole story is really fascinating. If you take John Meriwether, Eric Rosenfeld, Larry Hilibrand, Greg Hawkins, Victor Haghani, the two Nobel Prize winners, Merton and Scholes – if you take the sixteen of them – they probably have the highest average IQ than any sixteen people working together in one business in the country, including Microsoft or whatever you want to name. Incredible amount of intellect in that room. Now you combine that with the fact that those sixteen had extensive experience in the field they are operating. These are not a bunch of guys would make their money, you know, selling men’s clothing and all out of sudden went in the securities business or any. They had, in aggregate, the sixteen, probably 350 or 400 years of experiences doing exactly what they were doing. Then you throw into the third factor, most of them had virtually all of their very substantial net worth in the business, so they have their own money up, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money up. Super high intellect, working in the field they know, and essentially they went broke. That to me is absolutely fascinating. 

<br>

如果我要写本书，书名应该叫做《为什么聪明人会做蠢事》。我的合伙人说这本书应该写成自传（学生大笑）。这应该是一个有趣的例子。（长期资本管理公司）的人都是有不错的人。我尊重他们，在我在所罗门有麻烦的时候他们也帮过我。他们完全不是糟糕的人。但是，为了赚他们并不需要，并不拥有的钱，他们挺着损失已有的，本需要的钱的风险。这太愚蠢了。这单纯就很蠢。我不知道这样IQ意味着什么。如果你拿着对你来说重要的东西，拿来争取并不重要的东西，这完全不合理。我不管概率是否是100次赢1次输还是1000次赢1次输。如果你递给我一把枪，有着1000个弹仓，100万个弹仓，只有其中一个有子弹。然后你问我，“拿起这把枪指着你的太阳穴，你需要从我这里拿走多少钱，才会愿意拨动一次扳机？”我不会拨动的。你可以提出任何价格，但是对我来说这收益都毫无意义。我认为这个风险太明显了（学生大笑）。我对这种游戏并不感兴趣。但是人们似乎不假思索的参与这种金融游戏。

If I have to write a book it’s going to be call “why do smart people do dumb things.” My partner says it should be autobiographical. This might be interesting illustration. These are perfectly decent guys. I respect them and they helped me out when I was having problems in Solomon. They are not bad people at all. But, to make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. That’s foolish. that’s just plain foolish. I don’t know what such IQ is. If you risk something that is important to you, for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense. I don’t care whether the odds are a hundred one you succeed or a thousand one to succeed. If you hand me a gun with a thousand chambers, a million chambers, and there is one bullet in one of the chambers. You say, “put it up to your temple how much do you want to be paid to pull the trigger once?” I’m not gonna pull it. You can name any sum you want but it doesn’t do anything for me on the upside. I think the downside is fairly clear. I’m not interested in that kind of game. Yet, people do it financially without thinking about it very much.

<br>

曾有一本很好的书…并不是好书…只是有一个很好的标题…曾有一本有很好的标题的烂书（学生大笑），作者是沃尔特・古特曼，标题叫做《你只需要致富一次》。现在看起来道理很明了不是吗？如果你在年初有一亿，99%的可能性你用它大概能获得10%的收益，或者进行融资杠杆获得20%的收益。到最后一年结束了，1.1亿和1.2亿的区别有多大？并没有！如果你在年底不幸去世，写讣告的人写错了字。把1.2亿写成了1.1亿，结果你等于什么都没多赚（学生大笑）！对于你家人来说没有区别，绝对在任何情况下都没区别。但是在这其中存在的风险，尤其是你在管理他人的资产，将是赔掉自己的钱，以及面对朋友们时对于你造成的损失带来羞辱和不堪。我不敢相信在什么情况能让这种事情看来合理。然而这16人，有着高智商，有分寸的人，参与了这种游戏。我觉得这是一种疯狂。这来自于一个，从某种程度上说，过度依赖于，那些人所谓的6个西格玛事件，或者7个西格玛都不会触发的事。但他们错了。

There was a great book…not a great book, only with a great title…it is a lousy book written once with a great title by Walter Gutman, the title was “you only have to get rich once.” Now that seems pretty fundamental, doesn’t it? If you got a hundred million dollars at the start of the year and you are gonna make ten percent of your unleveraged – twenty percent if you are leveraged – 99 times out of 100, what difference does it make the end of the year if you got a 110 million and 120 million? Makes no difference at all! If you die at the end of the year, the guys who writes the story makes a typo. He may say 110 million even if you have 120 million, so you’ve gained nothing at all. It makes absolutely no difference! Makes no difference to your family, makes no difference to anything. Yet, the downside, particularly when you’re managing other people’s money is not only losing all your money but also disgrace and humiliation facing friends for money you have lost. I just can’t image an equation that makes sense for it yet sixteen guys with very high IQs, very decent people, entered that game. I think it is madness. It’s produced by an overreliance, to some extent, on things – those guys would tell me back when I was in Solomon that a six-sigma event wouldn’t touch or seven-sigma. But they are wrong. 

<br>

历史不会告诉你未来金融事物发生的概率。他们过度的依赖数学，觉得股票的贝塔能够告诉你股票的风险。它鬼才会告诉你股票的风险，在我看来。西格玛不会告诉你破产的风险，在我看来，也许现在在他们看来也如此了（学生大笑）。

History does not tell you the probability of future financial things happening. They had a great reliance on mathematics and they felt that the beta of a stock told you something about the risk of a stock. It doesn’t tell you a damn thing about the risk of a stock in my view. Sigma does not tell you about the risk of going broke in my view, maybe in their view now too.

<br>

我其实都不喜欢用他们来举例，因为同样的事情可以变成另一种形式发生。它可以在我们之间的任何人发生。因为我们对其他方面悉数掌握，我们会对某些重要的事情视而不见。就像亨利・考夫曼曾经说的：“那些在这种情况下破产的人有两种，第一种对什么都不了解，另一种是什么都了解。”这让人难过。我恳请你们…任何情况…我们（伯克希尔哈撒韦）基本上从未借钱，（尽管）我们会从来自保险的存浮金中取一些。我从未借钱，在我基本上只有1万块的时候也没借钱。（借钱）能带来什么改变呢？我一直以来都很开心。对我来说，有1万，100万，1000万都不代表任何事情，除了我有医疗上的紧急事故或者类似的。但是在我只有一点点钱和在我有很多钱的时候，我也会做相同的事情。

I don’t like even to use they as an example because the same thing in different ways can happen to any of us probably, where we really have a blind spot about something that is crucial because we know a whole lot about something else. It’s like Henry Kaufman said in the other day:” the people who are going broke in this situation are two types: the ones who knew nothing and the ones who knew everything.” It’s sad in a way. I urge you…in anything…we never basically borrow money – although we got float through insurance business. I never borrowed money: I never borrowed when I had 10,000 bucks basically. What difference that can make? I was having fun as I went alone. It didn’t mean anything when I had 10,000 dollars or a million dollars or 10 million dollars except if I have a medical emergency or something that comes along. But I’m gonna do the same things when I have a lot of money or when I have very little money. 

<br>

如果你想想你们和我之间生活上的差别。我们基本上穿的是一样的衣服。好吧太阳信托银行送了我身上这件T恤（学生大笑）。我们都有机会饮用上帝之泉（水）（译者注：一边说着巴菲特打开一听樱桃味可口可乐）（学生大笑），我们都去麦当劳，或者，更好的，冰雪皇后（译者注：巴菲特给自己的子公司打了一个广告）（学生大笑）。我们都住在冬暖夏凉的房子。我们都能用大屏幕看內布拉斯加州的，德克萨斯州的A&M比赛。我们看比赛的方式是一模一样的。意外发生时你会有一个不错的医疗保障，我也一样。唯一的区别是我们出行的方式：我坐着这小飞机（译者注：指他的私人飞机）（学生大笑），我爱这飞机。这蛮花钱的。但是如果你抛开这一点，除了出行，仔细想想，有什么我在做的你做不到？我从事自己喜爱的工作，但是我一直都做自己爱的工作。我爱现在的工作和我爱当时来说1000美元就是巨款的工作时是一样的。我恳求你们从事自己喜爱的工作。

If you think about the difference between me and you in terms of how we live. We wear the same cloth basically. All right, SunTrust gives me mine. We all have a chance to drink the juice of god here. We all go to McDonald or, better yet, Dairy Queen. We live in a house that’s warm in the winter and cool in the summer. We watch the Nebraska and Texas A&M on a big screen. You see it in the same way I see it. We do everything… our life ain’t that different, you know. You will get decent medical care when something happens to and I will get decent medical care. The only thing we do differently is we travel differently: I ride around this little plane and I love it. That takes money. But if you leave that aside, other than travel, think about it, what can I do that you can’t do? I get to work in a job that I love, but I always work in a job I love. I love it just as much when it was a big deal if I made a thousand bucks. I urge you to work in jobs you love. 

<br>

我认为你如果不停地从事不爱的工作，仅仅为了写在简历上好看，一定是疯了。我曾被一个哈佛的伙计邀请聊天，他当时28岁，说着他做过的事情，非常了不起。然我问他：“那你下一步做什么？”他说：“好吧，当我结束了我的工商管理硕士，我大概会去一家管理顾问公司工作，因为这在简历上看起来不错”我说：“等一下。你已经28岁了，你一直都在做这样的事情，我的意思是说你有着比我见过的人好上10倍的简历”我说：“如果你再做一份你不爱的工作，这是不是有点像是把性生活留在晚年享受？” （学生大笑）你需要开始从事你的事业的那一天会到来的 —— 我觉得我已经从刚刚的问题离题很远了 —— 如果你在大学毕业需要选一份工作，别选一个简历看起来好看的工作。选一个你热爱的工作。你未来可能会改变主意，但是你会开心地每天从床上跳起去上班。

I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don’t like because you think it’ll look good on your resume. I was with a fellow at Harvard the other day who was taking me over to talk to him. He was 28 and he told me what he had done in life, which is terrific. Then I said: “What are you going to do next?” He said: “Well, after I get out of my MBA, I think maybe I’ll go work for a management consulting firm because it looks good on my resume. I said: “Wait a second. You are 28, you have been doing all these things. I mean you have got a resume that’s 10 times as good as anybody I have ever seen.” I said: “If you take another job you don’t like, doesn’t a little like saving up sex for your old age?” There comes to a time when you ought to do what you are going to do – I think I’m out of the boarder of the question – If you ought to take a job when you get out of college, don’t take a job you think it’s going to look good on your resume. Take the job you love. You may change later on but you will jump out of the bed in the morning. 

<br>

当我从哥伦比亚大学毕业，第一件事情就是试着立刻为格雷厄姆工作。我说我愿意免费工作，结果他还是说我要价过高（学生大笑）。但是我不停的纠缠他。我回到了奥马哈市，这三年在父亲的公司卖证券。我不停的和他写信，提出一些我的想法。终于，我去他那里工作了两年。那段经历很美好。我总是在做着我喜欢的工作。

When I got out of Columbia, the first thing I tried is to go to work for Graham immediate. I offer to work for him for nothing. He said I was overpriced. But I kept pestering. I went to Omaha and sold securities for three years. I kept writing him and giving my ideas. Finally, I went to work for him a couple of years. It was great experience. I always really work in a job that I love doing. 

<br>

你真的应该选那些如果你能达到经济独立时都愿意选的工作。那才是你应该选的工作，因为这样你会有极大的乐趣而且能学到东西。你会因此非常兴奋并且很难再舍弃。你可能在未来会改变但是你依然还会有巨大的收获。我不管初始工资是多少或者是其他类似的事情 —— 我现在说的好像和刚开始的问题跑题但是既然已经说到这了 —— 我确实相信如果你以为你会因为赚两倍的工资会比一倍好，你大概是搞错了。我的意思是你应该找一些你喜欢的事情。为此工作。如果你认为赚10倍，20倍工资是解决一切问题的答案，你将会遇到大麻烦。因为你会因此在并不需要钱的时候借钱或者是在你雇主不希望的情况下投机取巧。这样做并不合理，当你回忆起过去的时候你不会喜欢的。

You should really take a job that if you are independently wealthy you will take.  That’s the job to take because that’s the one you’re going to have great fun and you’ll learn something, you’ll be excited about it and you can’t miss. You may go do something else later on but you’ll get way more out of it. I don’t care what the starting salary is or anything of the sort – I don’t know how I got off on that but there I am – I do think that if you think you’re going to be a lot happier if you’ve got 2X instead of X, you’re probably making a mistake. I mean you ought to find something you like. Works with that. You’ll get into trouble if you think making 10X or 20X is the answer to everything in life. Because then you will do things like borrow money when you shouldn’t or maybe cut corners on things your employer doesn’t want you to cut corners on. It just doesn’t make any sense. You don’t like it when you look back on it.

### 选能看懂的股票：找到有护城河的企业（21:15 - 28:35）

巴菲特：好的！（巴菲特点名让对方提问）

Buffett: Yep! (Buffett lets one of student audience to ask a question).

<br>

学生：你能和学生们说说你喜欢的公司吗？我不是指名字。我是说，是什么让这些公司…让你喜欢这些公司？

Student: Can you talk to the students about companies that you like? I don’t mean names. I mean what makes the companies…companies that you like.

<br>

巴菲特：我喜欢我能看懂的公司。这样一来，这就剔除了90%的公司了。（学生大笑）有各种公司我都不懂，不过幸运的是我能看懂的已经足够了。这个世界很大，而这几乎所有的公司都是上市公司。所以说基本上所有美国公司你都能够买一部分。这样看来，投资你能看的懂的公司是个合理的做法。你可以懂一些公司的。我能看懂这个。（巴菲特举起手中的樱桃味可口可乐）你可以看懂这个公司，每个人都可以。这是一个自从他们引入樱桃味可乐之后就没有再改变的产品。你知道的，自从1886年，或者之类的，他就是这样的简单的公司了。不一定是容易做的生意，我不希望一个生意即使对于竞争者来说也是很容易做的。我希望一个有护城河包围着它的公司。我想要的这种公司有一个珍贵的城堡。我想那个负责管理城堡的公爵会是一个诚实，努力，有能力的人。我希望这个城堡有巨大的护城河。

Buffett: I like…I like businesses I can understand. Let’s start with that. That narrows down about 90%. There are all kinds of thing I don’t understand, but fortunately there is enough I do understand. You have this big wide world out there, almost every company publicly owned. So you have all American businesses practically available to you. To start with, then it makes sense to go with things that you think you can understand. You can understand something. I can understand this! (Buffett is holding a tin of cherry-favored Cola) You can understand this, everybody can understand this! This is a product that basically hasn’t changed when they take out the cherry. You know, since 1886, or whatever it was, it is a simple business. It’s not an easy business, I don’t want a business that is easy for competitors. I want a business with a moat around it. I want a very valuable castle in the middle. Then I want the duke who’s in charge of that castle to be honest and hardworking and able. Then I want a big moat around the castle. 

<br>

护城河可以是很多东西。公司的护城河…比如像我们的汽车保险公司，政府员工保险公司，是低价。我的意思是，人们必须要买汽车保险。所以每个人基本上是要为每一辆车买一分保险…或者每一个司机。我不能给一个人卖20份，但是他们必须要买一份。那他们会选哪一份保险？他们会按照服务和价格来选择。大部分人会假设服务是几乎一样的，或者差不多的。所以我们做的就是价格！我需要成为低价提供者。这是我的护城河。我的价格进一步的低于他人？那我就相当于在护城河里放了几只鲨鱼。任何时候，如果你有一个很好的城堡，总有人在外面想要攻击它，拿走它。我想要我能看懂的城堡，但这城堡需要有护城河。

That moat can be various things. The moat in a business…like our auto insurance business, GEICO, is low cost. I mean, people have to buy auto insurance so everyone’s gonna have one auto insurance policy per car basically…per driver. I can’t sell them 20, but they have to buy 1. What are they gonna buy? They gonna buy on…base on service and cost. Most people will assume the service is fairly identical among companies or close enough. So we’re going to do on cost! I gotta be the low-cost producer. That’s my moat. My cost got further lower than the other guy? I’ve thrown a couple of sharks into the moat. All the time, if you got a wonderful castle, there are people out there are trying to attack it, taking away from you. I want a castle I can understand but I want a castle with a moat around it. 

<br>

30年前，伊士曼柯达的护城河和可口可乐的护城河一样宽。我的意思是如果你打算给你的6个月大的婴儿拍照片然后希望20年后，50年后能看一看 —— 你不知道未来的效果如何因为你不是专业摄影师，所以你也不知道那些20年前，50年前的照片的效果究竟好不好。在你心中你希望你理想的相片公司是最重要的事情，因为他们承诺你，你今天拍下来的对你来说重要的东西的照片在20年，30年，50年后看起来依然很不错。可能是你的宝宝或者别的。好吧，柯达在过去的30年做的非常好 —— 他们独占了这一点。他们有着我说的思想份额。忘了市场份额吧。思想份额。

30 years ago, Eastman Kodak’s moat was just as wide as Coca Cola’s moat. I mean if you gonna take a picture of your six-month-old baby and you’re gonna want to look at that picture 20 years from now, or you’re gonna want to look at that 50 years from now – you never got a chance because you are not professional photographer so you’re gonna to evaluate what’s gonna look like 20 or 50 years ago. What is in your mind about that photography company is what counts because they are promising you that the pictures you take today is going to be terrific to look at 20 years, 30 years, 50 years from now, about something that is very important to you. May be your own child or whatever may be. Well, Kodak had that in spades 30 years ago – they owned them. They had what I call “share of mind.” Forget about share of market. Share of mind. 

<br>

他们在每个人的心中都占据了一个位置，全世界，每一个国家。那个小黄盒子或别的，说着：“柯达是最好的。”这价值连城。他们失去了一些。但是还没有失去全部。不是因为乔治・费舍。乔治做的挺不错的。但是他们让护城河变窄了。他们让富士参与进来并且从各个方面缩小着护城河。他们让富士进入了奥林匹克这个领域，夺走了柯达那独特的一面，曾经只有柯达能够给奥林匹克拍照。富士参与了。立刻在人们心中，富士变得能和柯达平齐了。

They had something in everybody’s mind around the countries, around the world. The little yellow box or anything that said “Kodak is the best.” It’s priceless. They have lost some of that. They haven’t lost them all. It’s not due to George Fisher. George is doing a great job. But they let that moat narrowed. They let Fuji come and start narrowing the moat in various ways. They let them get into the Olympics and take away that special aspect that only…only Kodak was fit to photograph the Olympics. Fuji gets there. Immediately in people’s minds, Fuji becomes more in parity with Kodak.   

<br>

你还见不到可乐发生这样的事情。可乐如今的护城河比30年前要宽。你每天都去看，你肉眼察觉不到护城河的变化。但每一次，一个设施在某个国家建设完成，还未能达成盈利，但20年以后会，护城河又宽了一点。事情能够不断地变化，一个方向或者另一个方向。10年后你就能看出差距了。

You haven’t seen that with Coke. Coke’s moat is wider now than it was 30 years ago. You can’t see the moat (change) day by day. But every time, an infrastructure gets built in some country that hasn’t yet been profitable for Coke, but will be 20 years from now, the moat is widening a little bit. Things are all the time changing in one direction or the other. 10 years from now you can see the difference. 

<br>

我们公司的管理者，我给他们一个信息，那就是“让护城河变宽。”我们往护城河里面投入鳄鱼，鲨鱼，一切东西，短吻鳄，我猜，（学生大笑）来驱赶竞争者。方式可以是服务，可以是产品，可以是价格，有时可以是专利，可以是商铺地理位置的选择。这就是我想找的公司类型。

Our managers of our business we run, I got one message to them, which is “widen the moat.” We wanna throw crocodiles and sharks and everything else, gators I guess, into the moat to keep away competitors. That comes about through service. That comes about through quality of product. That comes about through cost. That comes about sometimes through patents. That comes about through real estate location. So that’s the business I’m looking for.

<br>

那么我要怎么找这些公司？好吧，我需要从简单的产品中找。因为我不知道甲骨文，莲花软件，或者微软10年的状况。我的意思是，盖茨是我见过最好的生意人。他能（在软件行业中）占据很好的地位。但是我真的不知道他们的公司10年会是什么样子。而且我也肯定不知道他们的竞争者10年后什么样子。这些是为什么我没有拥有这些名字（甲骨文，莲花，或微软）。我知道口香糖行业10年后怎么样。互联网不会改变人们咀嚼口香糖的方式。没有什么能改变我们咀嚼口香糖的方式。总会有无数多的新产品上市，但是箭牌的薄荷味，多汁果味的口香糖会在未来某一天消失吗？不会发生的。如果你给我10亿，让我进入口香糖行业，然后试着给箭牌口香糖带来实质性的伤害。我办不到。这就是我思考公司的方式。我会问自己，如果给我10亿，我能给这个人带来多少伤害？给我100亿…给我100亿，我能给可口可乐造成多少伤害？我办不到。这些都是优良的公司。给我一些钱然后让我去别的行业造成伤害，我是能想出办法做到的。

Now, what kind of business I’m gonna find like that? Well, I’m gonna find them in simple products. Because I’m not going to be able to figure out what the moat is going to look like for Oracle, or Lotus, or Microsoft ten years from now. I mean, Gates is the best businessman I ever run into. He got a hell of a position. But I really don’t know, what their business is going to look like ten years from now. And I certainly don’t know what their competitors are going to look like ten years from now. Now they’re the names I don’t own. I know what the chewing gum businesses are going to look like ten years from now. The Internet is not going to change everyone chew gum. Nothing much else is going to change how we chew gum. There are going to be lots of new products. Really, are spearmint, juicyfruit, all those, going to evaporate some day? They ain’t gonna to happen. If you give me a billion dollars and tell me to go into chewing gum business and trying to make a real dent in Wrigley’s. I can’t do it. That’s the way I think about businesses. I say to myself, give me a billion dollars, how much am I gonna to hurt this guy? Give me ten billion dollars…give me ten billion dollars, how much am I gonna hurt Coca-Cola around the world? I can’t do it. Those are good businesses. Give me some money and tell me to hurt somebody in some other fields, I can figure out how to do it. 

<br>

所以我需要简单的公司，容易理解，目前经济环境良好，诚实和有能力的管理层。然后我需要能够，粗略的，知道他们10年后的样子。如果我不知道他们10年后的样子？我不会买。基本上，我不会买那种，如果纽约股票交易所在明天开始休市5年，我不会开心地持有的公司。如果我买农场，而我将在未来5年不知道它的市价，如果农场一直挺好我也很开心。你知道的，如果我买一套公寓型房产，在未来5年不知道他的市价，如果它能够产生我期待的租金收入我也很开心。但是人们买股票，然后第二天起来看着价格，然后判断他们的选择是否是合理或者不合理。这很疯狂。因为买股票意味着买入公司的一部分。这是格雷厄姆教给我最基本的概念。你在买股票，你在买公司的一部分所有权。如果公司业绩良好你也会有很好的收益，只要你不要在买入的时候支付了一个高得愚蠢的价格。这就是全部了。你应该买你能懂得公司。就像你买农场的时候，你也买你能明白的农场。这不复杂。叫它“格雷厄姆巴菲特投资法”？这其实就是格雷厄姆的投资方法。

So I want a simple business, easy to understand, great economics now, honest and able management. Then I can see about, about in a general way, where they are going to be 10 years from now. If I can’t see where they are going to be ten years from now? I don’t want to buy it. Basically, I don’t want to buy any stock were they close the New York Stock Exchange tomorrow for 5 years I won’t be happy owning it. I buy a farm and I don’t get a quote on it for 5 years I’m happy if the farm does OK. You know, I buy an apartment house, don’t get a quote on it for 5 years, I’m happy if the apartment house produces the returns that I expect. But people buy a stock and they look at the price next morning and they decide whether they are doing well or not doing well. It’s crazy. Because they are buying a piece of business. That’s what Graham…most fundamental part what he had taught me. You are not buying a stock, you are buying a part ownership of the business. You will do well if the business does well if you didn’t pay a totally silly price. That’s what it all about. You ought to buy businesses you understand. Just like if you are buying a farm, you are going to buy a farm you understand. It’s not complicated. Call it just Graham Buffet? I mean, it’s just pure Graham. 

<br>

我当时非常幸运，在我19岁时打开了一本书（《聪明的投资者》，作者是格雷厄姆）。在我6,7岁时我对股票产生了兴趣。在我11岁时我买了第一支股票。我当时摆弄着各种东西。你懂的，我有图表信息，交易量信息，然后我做着各类的技术计算，还有别的一切。然后我打开了一本简单的书，里面说了你并不是在买一个每天跳来跳去的股票代号，你买的是公司的一部分。从那以后我都是用这个方式思考，剩下的一切都自然而然的发生了。非常简单。我们应该买入我们看的懂的公司。在座的没有人能不能明白可口可乐公司。我可以说在座的人没有一个能看懂某些新兴互联网公司。（演讲发生时巴菲特已经意识到了互联网泡沫，虽然当时大部分人并不知情）我在今年的股东大会上说：“如果我在一个商学院里面教书。在期中考试，我会给学生发放一些互联网公司的信息，然后让每个学生去估值。谁能给我一个答案我就让谁挂科。”（学生大笑）

I was very fortunate cuz I picked up a book when I was 19. I got interested in stock when I was 6 or 7. I bought my first stock when I was 11. I was playing around with all the stuff. You know, I had charts and volumes and I’m making all kinds of technical calculation or everything. And I then picked up a little book and it just said that you are not buying some little ticker symbol that bounces around every day. You are buying a part of a business. Since I started thinking about it in that wiring, everything else followed. Very simple. So we buy businesses we think we can understand. There is no one here who can’t understand the Coca-Cola company. I can say there is no one here who can understand some new internet companies. I said at the annual meeting this year: “If I were teaching a class in a business school. On a final exam, I will pass out the information on new internet companies and ask each student to evaluate them. Anyone who can give me an answer I will flunk.”

<br>

我不知道怎么估值，然而人们每天都在做这样的事情。如果你把这当做是一种竞赛或者什么，这倒是挺让人兴奋的。那这就是另一回事了。但是你是在投资。投资时在投入资本以后确认能在未来以合适的速率获得更多的钱。做到这样需要明白你在做着什么。你必须要了解你的公司。你可以了解一部分公司但不会了解每一个公司的。

I don’t know how to do that. But people do it every day. It’s more exciting, if you look at it as if it’s going to race or something. That’s a different thing. But you are in investing. Investing is putting out money to be sure getting more money back later at an appropriate rate. To do that you have to understand what you are doing at it. You have to understand the business. You can understand some businesses but not all businesses.

<br>

### 投资的估值很难：重点是寻找有定价能力的公司（28:35 – 35:00）

（巴菲特让下一个学生提问）

(Buffett lets one of student audience to ask a question)

<br>

学生：沃伦，你已经讲了其中的一半，也就是尝试了解公司并且找到适合投资的公司。但是你也暗示了以投资者的方式从投入公司的资本中获得回报。这就回到了你付出的投资成本（的问题上）了。你是如何确定你付给公司的价格是合理的？

Student: Warren, you have covered half of it, which is trying to understand the businesses and find businesses. But you had also alluded to getting a return on the amount of capital you invested in the businesses as an investor. That comes back to what you are paying for the businesses. How do you determine what you think it is the fair price to pay for the business?

<br>

巴菲特：这是一个难以下决定的事情但…任何公司如果我没有非常了解的话我是不会买的。但是即使我非常了解一个公司它也可能不会有很好的回报。我的意思是如果一个我看懂了的公司，公司经营的生意很容易做好，怎么又会提供一年40%或者类似的回报呢？所以我们不会把超高回报放在心上。但是我们在意的是别有任何损失。我的意思是，我们在1972年买下了喜诗糖果。喜诗糖果在那时每年以1.95美金的单价卖出1600万磅的糖果。它在当时在每磅赚两比特（相当于0.25美元，1比特 = 0.125），或者说一共400万美元的税前利润。我们当时支付了2500万美元。没有考虑运营资本的问题。当时我们看待这个公司的时候，基本上我的合伙人查理和我实际在考虑公司是否存在一些不受限的要价能力。换句话说，如果这糖果是以2美金或者2.25美金卖，是否也能像1.95美金每盒卖得一样好。因为如果你能以2.25美金就意味着30美分每磅的额外收入。在1600万磅的总销量看来就是480万美元。如果是这样的话，2500万的投资额挺好。我们没有做任何市场调研。我们这辈子从来没有请过顾问。我的意思是，我们对顾问的理解就是出门，买盒糖果，然后尝尝（学生大笑）。

Buffett: it’s a tough thing to decide but it…I don’t want to buy anything if I’m not terribly sure of. If I’m terribly sure of it probably doesn’t offer incredible returns. I mean, why should something is essentially a cinch to do well, offering you 40% a year or something like that. So we don’t have huge returns in mind. But we do have in mind never lose anything. I mean, we bought Cee’s Candy in 1972. Cee’s Candy was then selling 16 million pounds of candy at $1.95 a pound. It was making 2 bits of pound or 4 million pre-tax. We paid 25 million dollars for it. It took no capital to speak of. When we look at that business, basically my partner Charlie and I really decide whether there is a little uncapped pricing power there. In other words, whether that $1.95 box of candy could just as easily sell for $2 or $2.25. Because if you sell at $2.25 it adds another 30 cents a pound. It was $4.8 million on 16 million pounds. Which on a 25 million purchase price was fine. We didn’t do any marketing. We never hired a consultant in our lives. I mean, our idea of consulting is going out and buy a box of candy and eat it.

<br>

我们当时知道的是，喜诗糖果在加利福利亚州的人们心中占据了一定的分量。这里有一些特点之处：在每一个加利福利亚州的人心里，喜诗糖果都意味着些什么的。绝大多数情况下，这种印象都是美好的。他们会在情人节拿着这么一盒，然后递给女孩子。她就亲吻他。如果她扇了他一耳光，你知道的，我们就没生意做了（学生大笑）。但是只要她亲了他，这就是我们想在加利福利亚的人们心中留下的印象：喜诗糖果，被亲吻。如果我们能够在他们心里留下这个想法，我们就能抬高价格了（学生大笑）。我在1972年买下喜诗糖果，每年的12月26号，圣诞节后的一天，我们就会涨价。我们在圣诞节能卖很多。今年我们将会赚6000万美金。我们会卖3000万磅糖果，每磅赚2美金。还是原来的公司，原来的配方，原来的一切，6000万美金，额外的都是不花费额外的资本的。我们在未来10年会赚更多的钱。这6000万美元中大概5500万来自圣诞节前3周。我们公司的歌曲是：“耶稣是多么好的朋友！”（学生大笑）

What we did know was that they had share of mind in California. There is something special: every person in California have something in their mind about Cee’s Candy. Overwhelmingly it was favorable. They had taken a box on Valentine’s day and gave it some girl and she kisses him. If she slapped him, you know, we have no business. But as long as she kisses him, you know, that’s what we want in their mind: Cee’s Candy, getting kissed. If we can get that in the minds of people we can raise prices. I bought in 1972, every year we raise the price on December 26, I raise the day after Christmas. So everybody… we could sell a lot on Christmas. We’ll make 60 million dollars this year. We will sell 30 million pounds make $2 a pound. Same business, same formula, same everything, 60 million bucks, still doesn’t take any capital. And we’ll make more money 10 years from now. But that 60 million we make about 55 million in the three weeks before Christmas. Our company song is “what a friend we have in Jesus!” 

<br>

我的意思是，这是个好公司。关于这个公司重要的事是，想一想，人们不会买…大部分人不会买盒装巧克力自己吃。他们把它当做礼物买下来，你知道的，某些人的生日，或者更多的，节日。情人节是全年销量最高的一天。圣诞节是目前全年最大的旺季。女人为圣诞节买喜诗糖果，他们会提前规划好然后在圣诞节之前的两到三周购买。男人在情人节当天买。当他们正在开车在回家的路上，我们在收音机里播放广告，你懂的。罪恶感！罪恶感！罪恶感！罪恶感！你懂的，他们会拐出主干道（然后急着去买糖果）。（学生大笑）在我们的广告的影响下，他们是不敢在手中没有一盒糖果的情况下就回家的。（学生大笑）情人节是销量最高的日子。你能想象这么一个场景，在情人节回家的时候，我们的喜诗糖果因为我的聪明已经涨到了每磅11块了。（学生大笑）假如说现在有糖果是卖6美元每磅的。但你真的想在情人节的那天回家，递给 —— 我的意思是，这么多年我们都在心中对喜诗糖果有美好印象，当她看到你的时候，这也是她会在剩下的一整年记住你的方式，我的意思是我们已经把这个想法深入人心了 —— 然后你回到家中，然后说： “亲爱的，今年，我买了一个便宜的…”然后将糖果递给她？（学生大笑）我的意思是，这行不通的。从某种意义上说，它是一个…这里有一个不受限的要价能力…基本上是不受价格的影响的。

I mean, it is a good business. The important thing about that business is that, think about it a little, people don’t buy…most people don’t buy box of chocolate to consume themselves. They buy them as gifts, you know, somebody’s birthday, or more likely, it’s a holiday. Valentine’s day is the single biggest day of the year. Christmas is the biggest season by far. Women buy for Christmas and they plan ahead and buy over a two or three-week period. Men buy on Valentine’s day. They are driving home, we run ads on the radio, you know. Guilt! Guilt! Guilt! Guilt! You know the guys are steering off the freeway the freeway right and left. They won’t dare to go home without a box of candy when we get through with him on our radio ads. Valentine’s day is the biggest day. Can you imagine going home on Valentine’s day and our Cee’s Candy is now 11 bucks a pound thanks to my brilliance. Let’s say there is candy available at $6 a pound. But you really want to walk in on Valentine’s day and hand – I mean we have got all this favorable image of Cee’s Candy over the years and she sees you and that’s the way she thinks of you during the rest of year, I mean we have really got it badly – and you walk in and say: “honey, this year, I took the low bid…” and hand her a box of candy? I mean, it just doesn’t work. In a sense, it is a…there is an uncapped price…it’s not price dependent basically. 

<br>

想想迪士尼。我的意思是，迪士尼在卖，比如说，家庭影片…以…我不知道…16.95或者18.95或者别的价格出售。全世界来看，人们，或者我们说，在这种情况下特别指母亲们，在他们心中对迪士尼意味着些什么的。我的意思是，在座的每一个人，当你说迪士尼，在他们心中都意味着些什么。如果我说环球影业，你不会有（独特的）联想。如果我说二十世纪福克斯，你不会有独特的联想。但我说迪士尼，你会想到些什么。这在全世界范围内都是这样。现在想象一下你在和几个小孩子，你懂的，那些你愿意在晚年每天花几个小时去获得心灵的平静的那些小孩子。你知道如果你给他们一个影片他们会看上20次的。所以你去你买影片的影片店。你会在那里用上一个半小时，试看10个不同的影片，然后再决定哪个适合孩子们观看？不会的。我的意思是，如果这里有一个影片价格是16.95美元，然后迪士尼的影片是17.95美元。你知道如果你选了迪士尼的影片，你的选择不会错的！所以你买了。你不需要你不想花时间的事情上做一个高质量的选择。所以如果你是迪士尼，你可以赚更多的钱，而且你可以卖出更多的影片。这也是为什么迪士尼是一个优秀的公司。这让其他人来说（竞争）非常困难。你要如何创造一个能和迪士尼竞争的品牌 —— 梦工厂正在尝试 —— 但你如何能够创作出一个能和迪士尼竞争并且以别的品牌，比如说环球影业，替代原本迪士尼在人们心中处在的位置？所以这样一来母亲们将走进店里并选择环球影业而不是迪士尼？这不会发生的。 

Think of Disney, I mean, Disney is selling, will say, home video on…I don’t know…whatever… $ 16.95, $18.95 or whatever. All over the world, people, and we will say particularly, mothers in this case, have something in their mind about Disney. I mean, every person in this room, when you say Disney, have something in their mind about it. If I say Universal Pictures you don’t have anything (special) in your mind, you know. If I say 20th Century Fox, you don’t have anything special in your mind. But if I say Disney, you got something in your mind. That’s true around the world. Now picture yourself with a couple of young kids, you know, who you want to put away a couple of hours every day, when you get old, to get peace of mind. you know if you get them one video they will watch it 20 times. So you go to the video store where you buy the videos. Are you gonna sit there and premier, you know, 10 different videos and watch each for an hour and half after to decide which one your kids should watch? No. I mean, let’s say there is one there for $16.95 and in the Disney there it’s $17.95. You know if you take the Disney video, you gonna be OK! So you buy it. You don’t have to make a quality decision on something that you don’t want to spend the time to do. So you can get a little bit more money if you’re Disney, and you will sell a lot more videos. It makes it a wonderful business. It makes it very tough for the other guys. How would you try to create a brand – Dreamworks is trying – but how would you try to create a brand that competes with Disney around the world and to replace the concept that people have in their minds about Disney with something, say, Universal Pictures? So the mother’s gonna walk in and pick up the Universal Pictures video and preference to Disney? It’s not gonna happen. 

<br>

可口可乐和在令人们开心的场合时人们开心的状态联系在了一起。迪士尼世界，迪士尼乐园，世界杯都可以，或者奥林匹克，那些能让人们开心的场合。欢乐和可口可乐成为了一体。现在如果你给我，我不管多少钱，然后让我去用RC可乐这个品牌在世界范围内做到这样的影响力，然后让50亿人对RC可乐有着美好的印象？我做不到。你知道，你可以乱来…你可以做任何你想做的。你可以在周末做特价销售，一切。但是你一点都办不到可口可乐那样。这就是你希望在一个公司中找到的。这就是护城河。你希望这个护城河变宽。如果你是喜诗糖果，你希望做一切事情，能这礼物和人们的美好反应联系在一起。这就是这个盒子装着的东西。这就是卖给你糖果的人卖给你的东西。因为我们总是在我们极为忙碌的时候做我们的生意。我的意思是人们在圣诞节之前的那几周或者情人节那一天来光顾。店里会排成长队。下午五点，女员工正在将最后一盒糖果卖给最后一个客户。那个人已经等了前面20个或者30个客户了。如果销售员对最后一个顾客微笑，我们的护城河变宽了。如果她对他怒目，我们的护城河变窄了。我们肉眼看不到这个变化。但是这每天都在发生。这就是关键之处。我的意思是说，这个产品的递交过程就是让每一个部分都能将美好事物和喜诗糖果联系在一起。这就是商业的全部。

Coca-Cola is associated with people being happy around the world where every place they are happy. Disney World, or Disneyland, or the World Cup will be it, or the Olympics, where people are happy. Happiness and Coke go together. Now you give me, I don’t care how much money, and tell me I’m gonna do that with RC Cola around the world and have 5 billion people to have a favorable image in their mind about RC Cola? I can’t get done. You know, you can fool around…you can do anything you wanted to. You can have price discounts on weekends, anything. But you are not gonna touch it. That’s what you want to have in a business. That’s the moat. You want that moat to widen. If you are Cee’s Candy, you want to do everything in the world to make sure that the experience, basically, of giving that gift leads to a favorable reaction. That means that what’s in the box. It means the person that sells it to you. Because all our business is done when we are terribly busy. I mean people come in those weeks before Christmas or on Valentine’s day. There are long lines. Five o’clock in the afternoon, some woman is selling the last person the last box of candy. That person has been waiting in line for maybe 20 or 30 customers. If the salesperson smiles at the last customer, our moat is widened. If she snarls at him, our moat is narrowed. We can’t see it. It’s going on every day. But that’s the key to it. I mean, the total part of product delivery is having everything associated with the Cee’s Candy and something pleasant happening. That’s what business is all about.

### 定性分析比定量分析重要：找到你的能力圈（35:00 – 39:25）

巴菲特：好的!（巴菲特点名让学生提问）
Warren: Yeah! (Buffett lets one of student audience to ask a question).

<br>

学生：从你个人的经验来说，你会考虑多少量化上的分析和定性上的分析？你有没有遇到在数据告诉你不应该买的时候依然还是投资的时候？

Student: On a personal account, how much quantitative analysis you would consider versus qualitative analysis? Have you ever bought a business when the numbers told you not to?

<br>

巴菲特：那些都是最佳的投资…问题问的是“我是否曾经在数据让我别买的时候买下一家公司，还有量化分析和定性分析的比重各是多少”。最好的投资时那些数据几乎告诉你别买的。我的意思是，因为，这样你就对公司的产品足够看好，而不是因为你已经习惯了“烟蒂一般的便宜”。（购买烟蒂股的）诱惑很大。我曾经拥有过一家风车公司。你知道吗，风车是烟蒂，相信我。（学生大笑）我买下的时候非常便宜，我用他三分之一的运营资本买下的。我们赚了钱。但是从这里赚不到持续的现金。这差不多是一个一次性的收益。这不是我应该做的事情。我经历过那个阶段。我买过有轨电车公司，各种的。至于定性分析，我大概能在接到电话那一刻了解到公司的性质。几乎全部的公司的购买都是在5分钟或者10分钟内完成的。我的意思是，关于分析。今年我们买了两个公司。通用保险是，你知道吗，180亿或者类似的，的交易。我从来没有去过他们的总部。我希望总部确实存在。（学生大笑）那里可能只是几个人，说：“好吧，这个月的数据发给巴菲特的数据应该写些什么呢？”他们每周或者每个月会过来告诉我：“我们这个月银行里面有200亿而不是180亿”等等的。但是我从未去过。

Buffett: Those are the best buy…the question is “have I ever bought a company where the numbers told me not to and how much is qualitative and how much is quantitative” The best buy has been the numbers almost tell you not to. I mean, because, then you feel so strongly about the product and not just the fact you are getting used to the “cigar butt cheap.” It’s compelling. I owned a windmill company at one time. You know, windmills are cigar butt, believe me. I bought it very cheap, I bought it a third working capital. We made money out of it. But there is no repetitive money to be in there. It’s a one-time profit, or something like that. It’s not the thing to be doing. I went through that phrase. I brought streetcar companies, all kinds of things. In terms of the qualitative, I probably understand the qualitative the moment I get the phone call. Almost every business we bought, it has taken 5 or 10 minutes. I mean, in terms of analysis. We bought two businesses this year. General Re is, you know, 18 billion, or something, deal. I’ve never been to their home office. I hope it’s there. There could be just a few guys and say: “Well, what numbers should we send Buffett this month?” I can see them coming here once a week or month (and they may say) “We’ve got 20 billion in the bank this month instead of 18 billion” or something. I have never been there.

<br>

在我买下商务机公司之前，也就是飞机的部分所有权。在买下之前，我从来没去过（他们的公司）。三年前我为我家买下那个项目的四分之一所有权。我见过他们的服务，看起来发展的挺好。我有数据。如果你不能够拥有能在一瞬间就能下决定的了解，那你不会在一个月或者两个月内明白一个公司。我的意思是，你必须有一些背景知识，而且知道哪些你是明白的而哪些是不明白的。这是关键。这是我所说的定义你的能力圈。每个人都有不同的能力圈。重要的不是圈的大小，重要的是待在圈内。如果那个圈里只有30家公司，而总体是上千家公司。只要你明白那30家公司是哪些，那就可以了！你应该对这些公司足够了解，所以你不需要做很多阅读和分析工作。我在早些年做过很多工作，单纯是了解各种公司。

Before I bought Executive Jet, which is fractional ownership of jets. Before I bought it, I had never been there. I bought my family a quarter interest in the program 3 years earlier and I had seen the service and seemed developed well. I got the numbers. If you don’t know enough to know about the business instantly, you won’t know enough in a month or two months. I mean, you have to have some sort of the background of understanding and knowing what you do understand and don’t understand. That’s key. It’s what I call defining your circle of competence. Everyone got a different circle of competence. The important thing is not how big the circle is. The important thing is staying inside the circle. If that circles only got 30 companies in it out of thousands on the big board. As long as you know which 30 they are, you are OK! You should know those businesses well enough so that you don’t need to read or do lots of works. I did a lot of works in the earlier years, just to get familiar with businesses. 

<br>

我的方法是我会出门然后用菲利普・费雪说的“闲聊法”。我会出门，和顾客聊，和…某些时候和前员工聊，和供应商聊，所有人。每一次我见到一个产业的人，比如说，我当时对可乐行业感兴趣。我会四处拜访可乐公司，并且问每一个CEO：“如果你只能买除了自己公司的一家可乐公司的股票，你会选哪家，为什么？”你把信息收集起来，然后不久你就会学到很多。而且，搞笑的是，你会得到非常类似的答案，如果你问的是关于竞争者。我会问：“如果你有一颗银弹（在西方文化，银弹有极强驱魔能力，在这里指能让竞争者立刻破产的方法），你可以打进任何一个竞争者的脑袋里，你会选谁，为什么？”你会意识到谁是行业里面最强的人，那个让大家出乎意料的人。所以有很多你能从公司中学习的东西。我过去做了这种事情，在那些我认为我能理解的行业中。我现在不需要再做这样的事情了。投资的好处就是你不是所有知识都是全新的。我的意思是，你可以依然这么做（将自己沉浸在新信息里），但是如果你在40年前对箭牌口香糖有了解，你现在还是能看懂箭牌口香糖的。这并没有很多需要洞察的或者类似的。你会（在脑内）建立起一个数据库的。

The way I would do that is I would go out and use what Phil Fisher called the “Scuttlebutt approach.” I would go out, I talked to customers, I talked to…maybe ex-employees in some cases, I talked to suppliers, everybody. Every time I see somebody in an industry, let’s say, I was interested in the Cola industry. I would go around to see every Cola company and I would ask every CEO: “If you can only buy stock in one Coke company which was not your own, which one would it be, and why?” You piece those things together and you will learn a lot about the business after a while. And, it’s funny, you will get very similar answers as long as you ask about competitors. I would say it: “If you got a silver bullet, you can put it through the head of one competitor. Which competitor and why?” You will find out who the best guy in the industry in that case…the one that is coming up. So there is a lot of thing you can learn about a business. I have done that in the past, on the business I feel I could understand. I don’t have to do much of that anymore. The nice thing about investing is that you don’t have to learn everything very new. I mean, you can do If you want to, but If you know about Wrigley’s chewing gum 40 years ago, you still understand Wrigley’s chewing gum. It’s not a lot of great insights to get or anything of the sort. You do get a database in there. 

<br>

我有一个伙计，弗兰克・鲁尼，在梅尔维尔工作很多年了。他的岳父去世了，岳父的公司叫H.H.布朗，一个鞋业公司。他当时在咨询高盛是否有兴趣买入。那会儿他在和我的一个朋友在佛罗里达打高尔夫，并且和我朋友提到这个事情。我朋友说： “你怎么不和沃伦打个电话？” 他在打完高尔夫之后和我打了电话，5分钟之后，我基本上就决定要买下来了。

I have a guy, Frank Rooney, who ran Melville for many years. His father-in-law died and had owned H.H. Brown, a shoe company. He put it up with Goldman Sachs. But he was playing golf with a friend of mine here in Florida and mentioned it to this friend. The guy said: “why don’t you call Warren?” He called me after the golf match and in 5 minutes I basically had a deal. 

<br>

但我了解弗兰克，而且我明白这个行业。我大致了解鞋业的基本经济情况，所以我可以买这个公司。量化的层面的话，我还需要分析一下价格是应该是如何。但是，你知道的，答案无非是买或者不买。我的意思是，当我在做谈判的时候，我不打算在量化的事情上闲耗。如果他们的价格对我来说合理，我就买。如果不合理，那我还是和之前一样开心的，即使没有这公司，我未来也是同样开心的。

But I knew Frank, and I know the kind of business. I sort of knew the basic economics of the shoe business, so I could buy it. Quantitatively, I got to decide what the price is. But, you know, that is either yes or no. I mean, I don’t fool around a lot when I got into negotiations. If they name a price that makes sense to me, I buy it. If they don’t, you know, I was happy the day before, so I will be happy the day after without owning it. 

<br>

### 投资可口可乐：重点是选股而不是时机（39:25 - 45:20）

巴菲特：好的!（巴菲特点名让学生提问）
Warren: Yeah (Buffett lets one of student audience to ask a question)! 

<br>

学生：可口可乐发布了他们的下个季度的利润预期，回报，还有未来收益。考虑到可口可乐有大量的利润来自于美国海外，你认为亚洲金融危机什么的会怎样影响可乐的全球商业？

Student: Coca-Cola has announced their profit expectation, return, and future earnings in the following quarters earnings. In light of the fact that Coke have lots of their profits coming in from the outside of United States, how do you think of the Asian crisis so as to speak is going to affect Coke regarding its business around the world? 

<br>

巴菲特：问题是“亚洲金融危机以及它会如何影响类似于可乐，可乐最近发布了他们的收益，这样的公司“。实际上，他们在几周前刚发布了第三季度的收益。这些数据给人们暗示了第四季度的收益会更低。

Buffett: The question is about the Asian crisis and how does it affect companies like Coke that recently announced the earnings. Actually, they just announced their third-quarter earnings a few weeks ago. They tipped people off: there will be lower in the fourth quarter also. 

<br>

好吧，我基本上还是喜欢它的，因为国际（严格来说是海外）上，可口可乐的产品的市场在未来的20年增长会超过美国。国际上人均使用的增长率也会超过美国。事实是未来 —— 谁知道呢，3个月，或者3年 —— 将会是困难的阶段，但这个利空情况不会持续20年。我的意思是人们依然会，你知道的，努力工作。他们会发现这是一个每天买上一瓶，或者更好的，像我一样五瓶，相对于他们的工资收入来说会是超值的产品。

Well, basically I love it because the market for Coca-Cola’s products is going to grow far faster over the next 20 years internationally than it will in the United States. It will go over the United States on a per capita basis because they will grow faster elsewhere. The fact that it’s going to be a tough period for – who knows – 3 months or 3 years, but it won’t be tough for 20 years. I mean people are still going to, you know, work productively around the world. They are going to find that this is a bargain product in terms of the potion of their working day that they have to give up in order to have one of these, or better yet, 5 of them in a day like I do.

<br>

这是一个，你知道的，这样的产品，在1936我第一次用25美分买了6瓶装的这些然后按每个5美分的价格卖出。当时它们是单价5美分的6.5盎司（约192毫升）瓶子，其中2美分是瓶子的押金。也就是说在那时，6.5盎司的单价是5美分。现在在周末买组合装的话是每瓶12盎司（约354毫升）的罐子…因为包装并不怎么花钱。你本质上是用不比20美分多多少的价格卖12盎司。你支付的价格并不比1936年高多少。相对于人们的工资来说这是一个变的越来越来越便宜的的产品，而且大家都很喜欢这个产品。你有一个，在200个国家， 100多年历史，在市场上占据大量份额，人均使用每年都在上升的产品。我的意思是，这不可思议。人们不理解的一点的是，也是让这个产品价值百亿的一点，是关于旧可乐的一个简单事实 —— 让我们叫它可口可乐，我喜欢这个名字。

It’s a, you know, this is a product, in 1936 when I first brought six of those for a quarter and sold them for a nickel each. It was in a 6.5-ounce bottle and you pay the 2 cent deposit on the bottle. That was a 6.5-ounce bottle for a nickel at that time. It’s now a 12-ounce can which you can buy it on weekends if you are buy in bigger quantity because…so much money doesn’t go into the packaging. You essentially can buy the 12 ounces for not much more than 20 cents. You are paying not much more than twice the per ounce price in 1936. It’s a product that has gotten cheaper and cheaper and cheaper relative to people’s earning power over the years, and which people love. In 200 countries, you have a per capita use going up every year for a product of over 100 years old and dominates the market. I mean, that’s unbelievable. One thing that people don’t understand, that is one thing that makes this product, that worth tens and tens of billions of dollars, is one simple fact about – really, old Cola – but we will call it Coca-Cola for the moment, the name I like.

<br>

可乐没有味觉记忆。你可以在9点，11点，3点，5点喝上其中一瓶。5点喝的那一瓶和早上喝的那瓶味道一样好。你在奶油汽水，根汁汽水，橙汁味汽水，葡萄味汽水，任何一个你想得到的，复制不到这一点。这些都会在你身上累积。大部分果汁和饮品都会在你身上累积。过一段时间你就会腻。如果你吃…我的意思是，我们想鼓励人们来喜诗糖果上班。我和他们说： “你们可以吃你想要的全部糖果。” 他们在第一天都开心疯了。（学生大笑）但是一周以后他们吃的量和让他们付钱时吃的一样多。巧克力在你身上累积。（除了可乐）一切都会在你身上累积。可乐没有味觉记忆。这意味着你在全世界，有着那些重度可乐消费者，每天会喝五瓶，或者健怡可乐，或者每天7,8瓶什么的。人们对于其他产品不会做这样的事情。你有一个难以置信的人均消耗。在这里的人们，可能在这里的（佛罗里达）北面，每天喝大约64盎司（约1.89升）的水分。你可以让着64盎司喝的都是可乐。至少如果你原来就喜欢，你不会腻的。但是如果你试着在其他的产品做类似的事情，让你只是有一个产品，没过多久你就会腻。

Cola has no taste memory. You can drink one of these at 9 o’clock, 11 o’clock, 3 o’clock, 5 o’clock. The one that you drink at 5 o’clock will taste just as good to you as the one drank early in the morning. You can’t do that with Cream Soda, Root Beer, Orange, Grape, you name it. All of those things accumulate on you. Most juices and beverages accumulate on you. You get sick of them after a while. If you eat… I mean, we get these people go to work for Cee’s Candy. We told them: “you all get the candy you want.” The first day they all go crazy. But after a week they are eating about the same amount they are eating as if they are buying it. Chocolate accumulates on you. Everything accumulates on you. There is no taste memory to Cola. That means you get people around the world, there are heavy users that will drink five a day or diet coke or maybe 7, 8 a day or something of the sort. They will never do that with other products. You get this incredible per capita consumption. The average person in this part of the world, may be a little north of here, drinks about 64 ounces of liquids a day. You can have all 64 ounces of that be Coke. You will not get fed up with coke, if you like it, to start with, in the least. But if you get with almost anything else, you will just eat one product all day you tend…you will get a little sick of that after a while.

<br>

这是一个巨大的要素。今天，超过10亿的8盎司（237毫升）装的可乐产品将在全球出售。这个数字每年都会增加。这个数字几乎在每个国家都会增加。在人均使用量上也会增加。20年后国际上的增长率会超过美国。我真的更喜欢这种市场因为增长会随着时间越来越快。但是，那（最近的亚洲金融危机）会伤害他们的商业，这正在伤害他们的商业。但这不代表什么。

It’s a huge factor. Today, over one billion eight-ounce servings of Coca-Cola’s products will be sold in the world. That will grow year by year. That will grow in every country virtually. It will grow on a per capita basis. 20 years from now it will grow a lot faster internationally than in the US. I really like that market better because there is more growth there over time. But, it will hurt them in… it is hurting them in the short term right now. But that doesn’t mean anything. 

<br>

可口可乐在，我相信是1919年，上市。股份按每股40美金出售。在这之前是钱德勒家族（拥有的）。他们之前…他们用2000块买下了整个公司。在20世纪80年代时是钱德勒家族，还有一系列的购入。然后在1919年可口可乐上市了，每股40美金。一年以后售价是19美金一股，在一年内损失了50%。你可能认为这是某种灾难。你可能会认为糖的价格上涨了然后瓶装公司并不是很友好，等等一系列事情。你总是能找到一些你不买可口可乐公司股票的原因。几年后你遇到了大萧条。然后你遇到了第二次世界大战。然后你遇到了糖的定量配给限制。然后你遇到了核武器的出现。全部事情…总有一个原因（让你决定不买）。但是如果你买下了40元的一股然后将所有股息再投资，现在你有的是价值50亿的股票了。这个因素远超过了其他的一切，我的意思是，如果你选对了公司，你会赚很多的钱。时机的选择是一个非常难的事情。我不会担心某些特定事件，如果我选对了公司，在第二年会造成什么影响，或者类似的。你知道的，这个国家在很多时期出现过价格管制。即使是最好的那些公司都受到了影响。你知道的，如果有价格管制，我是没办法在12月26号为喜诗糖果涨价的。我们曾经遇到过，但是这不代表喜诗糖果不是好公司，因为价格管制不会永远存在。在70年代的早期价格管制确实存在。

Coca-Cola went public in, I think it is 1919. Stocks sold for $40 a share. Went back before that is the Chandler family. They went back…they bought it for 2,000 bucks for the business. It is the Chandler back in the late 1880s and a couple of purchases. Then it went public in 1919, $40 a share. One year later it was selling for $19 dollars, going down 50% in 1 year. You might think it was some kinds of disaster. You might think that sugar prices increased and the bottlers were rebellious, and all bunch of things. You could always find a few reasons why that wasn’t the ideal moment to buy it. Years later you have seen the Great Depression. Then You have seen the World War II. Then you have seen sugar rationing. Then you have seen thermonuclear weapons. The whole thing…there is always a reason. But in the end if you bought 1 share for 40 bucks and reinvested the dividends it would be worth about 5 billion now. That factor so overrides anything else, I mean, if you are right about the business, you will make a lot of money. The time part of it is a very tricky thing. I don’t worry about any given event, if I have got a wonderful business, whether what it does the next year, something of the sort. You know, price controls had been in this country various times. That fouled up even the best of businesses. I mean, I wouldn’t able to raise the prices on December 26 of the Cee’s Candy, if we have price control. We had them in this country but that doesn’t make it a lousy business if that happens because you not going to have price controls forever. We had them in the early 70s. 

<br>

优秀的公司，你知道的，你可以明白什么会发生，但你不知道会何时会发生。你不会想把太多精力集中在时机上，你需要集中选择公司上。如果你选对哪个公司，你不需要考虑太多时机的问题。

The wonderful business, you know, you can figure out what will happen, you can’t figure out when they will happen. You don’t want to focus too much on when, you want to focus on what. If you are right about what, you don’t have to worry about when very much. 

<br>

### 曾经的错误：生活需要向前看（45:20 – 49:55）

巴菲特：有没有哪一个区域我没有注意到（译者注：巴菲特扫视了一下观众席）？任意一处？因为我想确认我没有将注意力集中在一处。这里有个男士（巴菲特点名让对方提问）。

Buffett: Is there an area I’m missing back there? Any place? Because only I want to make sure I’m not focusing all at one place. I mean, we got this gentleman over here (Buffett lets one of student audience to ask a question).

<br>

学生问：大部分成功的…（听不清楚）…哪些…（听不清楚）…错误你曾犯过…愿意去…（听不清楚）

Student: Most successful…(unclear)…what…(unclear)…mistakes have you made…willing to make…(unclear)

<br>

巴菲特：所以你的问题是问我“曾经工作上犯下的错误”？那要看你能听多久（学生大笑）？有意思的是，在投资中 —— 至少对于查理芒格还有我来说 —— 最大的错误来自于不作为而并非作为，在我们对于投资机遇已经知道足够多能够有所作为的时候。但是因为这样那样的原因我们坐在那里像孩子一样吮吸着大拇指什么都没做。我们错过了无数价值10亿的投资机遇。就不谈那些我们看不懂的。我可能可以从微软那里赚几十亿，但那并不意味着什么，因为我从来不明白（怎么分析）微软。但是我可以从健康保障股中获得几十亿的，我们可以做到的。我并没有行动。当时克林顿的健康保障计划被提出并被智囊团接受，我们本可以从这赚巨额的金钱，因为我明白这是什么。我并没有行动。在80年代的时候（译者注：演讲发生在1998，还是20世纪）我可以从房利美中获得几十亿的。我明白它是什么，但是我没有行动。这些都是美国GAAP会计准则捕捉不到的十亿级的错误，数十亿级的错误（学生大笑）。

Buffett: The question is about my business mistakes or how much time do you have. The interesting thing about business is this: in investments – at least for me and for my partner Charlie Munger – the biggest mistakes have not been mistakes of commission but they’ve been mistakes of omission where we knew enough about the business to do something. For one reason or another, we sat there sucking our thumbs instead of doing something. We’ve passed up things where could have made billions and billions of dollars from things we understood. Forget about things we don’t understand. The fact that I can make billions from Microsoft but it doesn’t mean anything because I never understand Microsoft. But I can make billions out of healthcare stocks and we should have made it. I didn’t. When the Clinton healthcare program was proposed and they all went in the tank, we should’ve made a ton of money out of that because I can understand it. I didn’t make it. I should have made a ton of money out of Fannie Mae back in the mid-eighties. I understood it and I didn’t do it. Those are billion-dollar mistakes – or multibillion dollars mistakes – that the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles don’t pick up. 

<br>

你们能（从财务报表上）看到的…我们犯下的错误…那不是“我们”…几年前我曾错误的买下的了全美航空公司的优先股。我意思是我那是有很多的闲钱，每当我有钱我就会犯错，查理告诉我：“去酒吧，别待在办公室。”但是我当时在办公室里，口袋里又有钱。我随后就做了一个蠢事。这种蠢事总是发生。我买了这玩意（全美航空公司），没人劝我买。如今我有一个800的号码，每当我想买航空公司的股票的时候我就会呼叫，另一端的人就会让我冷静下来。我会说：“我是沃伦，我迷恋航空公司。”然后另一头的伙计会说：“接着说吧，别挂电话，别做冲动的事情！”最后我会冷静下来的。但我…我当时是买了你们知道的。当时看起来我们将要把我们投入的所有钱都赔光。我们当时几乎要赔光了。你可以说损失全部投入对我们的报应。

The mistakes you see…we made a…it isn’t “we” …I made a mistake buying US Air preferred some years ago. I mean I had a lot of money around. I make mistakes when I get cash. Charlie tells me: “to go to a bar instead, do not hang around the office.” But I hanged around the office and I got money in my pocket. I just did something dumb. It happens every time. I bought this thing, nobody made my buy it. I now have an 800 number I call every time I think about buying stocks in the airline and they will talk me down. I will say: “I’m Warren and I’m air-aholic.” Then the guy will say: “keep talking, don’t hang up, don’t do anything rash!“ Finally I will get over. But…I…I bought it you know. It looked like we were gonna lose all our money in that. We came very close to losing all our money. You can say we deserve to lose our money.

<br>

我买下它（全美航空的优先股）的原因只是因为它看起来是不错的证券，但是公司本身并不吸引人。我在所罗门上的投资也做了一样的事情。我买了我不会买他们的权益的这么一个公司的优良的证券（所罗门的可转换优先债权）。你可以说这是一种错误的类型：买了某个东西只是因为你觉得条款不错，但你并不喜欢这个公司。这是我曾经犯过的错误，将来可能还会。

We brought it because it was an attractive security, but not an attractive business. I did the same thing with Solomon. I brought an attractive security in a business I wouldn’t have bought the equity in. So you can say that’s one form of mistake: buying something because you like the terms when you don’t like the business that well. I have done that in the past, probably will do it again.

<br>

但更显著的错误来自于自于不行动。

The bigger mistakes are the ones from omission.

<br>

我曾做 —— 当我有了1万块的时候 —— 我将其中的2000投资了辛克莱服务中心，而这笔投资我全赔掉了。所以如今我的机会成本大概是60亿（学生大笑）。挺大的错误。伯克希尔的股价下跌的话我心情反而会好一些，因为这样我的辛克莱服务中心的成本也会变小（学生大笑） —— 因为我那20%的机会成本。

I did – back then I had 10,000 bucks – I put 2,000 dollars of them in the Sinclair service station, which I’ve lost. So my opportunity cost is about 6 billion right now. Fairly big mistake. It makes me feel better when Berkshire goes down because the cost of my Sinclair service station goes down too. My 20% opportunity cost.

<br>

但是我会说，你说到从错误中学习。我得说从别人的错误中学习比从自己的错误中学习要好不少（学生大笑）。但是在伯克希尔我们从来不花时间后悔。我有个伙伴，查理芒格，40年的伙计了，从来没吵过架。我们常常有不同意的观点，但我们从来不为这些争论。但我们都不花时间后悔。我们意识到有太多值得期待的事情，以至于思考过去如果做了什么毫无意义。这什么也改变不了。我的意思是，你的生活必须向前看。

But I will say this. You talked about learning from mistakes. I really believe it’s better to learn from other people’s mistakes as much as possible. But we don’t spend any time looking back at Berkshire. I got a partner, Charlie Munger, who has been pals for 40 years, never had an argument. We disagree on things a lot, but we don’t have argument about them. We never look back. We just figured there is so much to look forward to, there is just no sense thinking about what we might have done. It just doesn’t make any difference. I mean you can only live your life forward. 

<br>

你可以能从错误中…学到一些…重要的事是你应该和你了解的公司待在一起。所以这里有一个跳出了你的能力圈外的
一般性的错误。你知道的，在某个你其实没有认真思考过的领域，因为有人秘密告诉你了一些信息或者类似的事而做出投资…你应该从中学习。你应该和你能理解的事物待在一起。你应该要让你的决策像…看着镜子。对自己说：“我在55一股的价格买100股通用汽车因为…”如果买它，这是你的责任。这应该是有一个原因的。如果你不能说明原因，你不应该买。因为有人在鸡尾酒派对和你提到的？不够好。应该要有某些…你懂吗…不能因为交易量，图表看起来不错，或者任何类似的。这应该是有一个你买这公司的原因的。那个原则…我们非常谨慎的遵守着。那是本格雷厄姆教会我的其中一个东西。

You can learn something, perhaps from the mistakes… the big thing you should do is to stick with businesses you understand. So there is a generic mistake of getting outside of your circle of competence. You know, buying something because somebody tips you off or something of the sort in an area you don’t really think about…you should learn something from that. You should stay with what you can figure out yourself. You really want your decision-making to be…by looking in a mirror. Saying to yourself: “I’m buying 100 shares of General Motors at 55 because…” it’s your responsibility if you are buying it. It’s gotta be a reason. If you can’t state the reason, you shouldn’t buy it. Because somebody told you at a cocktail party? Not good enough. It’s gotta be something…you know…it can’t be because the volume, the chart looks good, or anything like that. It’s gotta be a reason you buy the business. That…we stick to it very carefully. That’s one of the things Ben Graham had taught me.

### 宏观经济难以预测：别在意宏观（49:55 – 51:45）

巴菲特：好的！（巴菲特点名让对方提问）

Buffett: Yep!

<br>

学生：将来的大致的全球经济会是怎么样的？还是说我们的经济依然处于挣扎的阶段？我们正在往哪个方向发展？未来的利率会怎么变化？

Student: What will be current general economic situation around the world? Or our economy is simply still not jiggering along quite well, where are we going? When could happen on interest rate?

<br>

巴菲特：问题是关于利率将出现什么以及在这世界我们正在往哪个方向发展。我不考虑这些宏观的东西。我只是…重要的…在你的投资里你应该要做的是明白什么是重要的和可知的。如果某事并不重要也不可知，你就忘了吧。你刚刚说的是重要的，但是在我看来并不可知。明白可口可乐是可知的，或者箭牌，或者伊士曼柯达。你可以看懂这些公司。这些是可知的。重要的是你的估值，公司的价格，所有的那些。但是我们从来没有因为对于宏观上的任何一种感受去买入或者卖出一个公司。我们不读那些经济，公司，或者类似的预测因为这改变不了什么。

Buffett: the question is about what is going to happen on interesting rates and where we are going now in the world. I don’t think about the macro stuff. I just…important…what you really want to do in your investment is to figure out what’s important and knowable. If it is unimportant and unknowable, you forget about it. What you talked about is important but in my view it’s not knowable. Understanding Coca Cola is knowable, or Wrigley’s, or Eastman Kodak. You can understand those businesses. That’s knowable. What it turns out to be important depends on what you evaluation be, the firm price, all of that. But we have never either bought a business or not bought a business because of any macro feeling of any kind. We don’t read things about predictions about interesting rates or business or anything like that because it doesn’t make any difference. 

<br>

我的意思是，比如说1972年我们买入喜诗糖果的时候。好像尼克松没多久就颁布了价格管制。如果说我们预测到了（并从此没有买）。那怎样？我们会因此错过了用2500万买下一个每年税前赚6000万的公司。我们不想因为让一些我们其实并做不好的预测，导致我们错过那些聪明的买入机会。所以我们不读，不听，不做任何有关宏观因素的东西。从不。典型的投资咨询组织会出来，给你…他们带来他们的经济学家，他们把（宏观信息）画出表格，给你一个宏观的大图，然后并从这开始…往下…做工作。在我们看来没什么道理。如果艾伦・格林斯潘在我的一侧，罗伯特・鲁宾在我的另一侧，他们一起和我耳语接下来12个月他们要做的一切，这并不会让我任何改变任何我将支付公务机航空公司或者通用再保险的价格，或者别的我做的事。

I mean, let’s say in 1972 when we bought Cee’s Candy. I think maybe Nixon put on the price controls a little bit later. Let’s say we had seen that. So what? We’ve had missed the chance to buy something for 25 million that is earning 60 million pre-tax now. We don’t want to pass up the chance to do something intelligent because of some predictions about something that we were no good at it anyway. So we don’t read, or listen to or do anything in relation to the macro factors at all. Zero. The typical investment counseling organization goes out and they give you…they bring out their economists, they chart them out, give you the macro picture and then they start to working from there on and…down. In our view that’s non-sense. If Alan Greenspan was on one side of me and Robert Rubin on the other side and they both were whispering in my ear exactly what they were going to do the next twelve months, it wouldn’t make any difference to me what I would pay for Executive Jet or General Reinsurance or anything else I do. 

<br>

### 不在华尔街的好处：投资需要一个人独自思考（51:45 – 54:15）

巴菲特：好的！（巴菲特点名让对方提问）

Warren Buffett: Yep!

<br>

学生：相对于待在华尔街里，作为一个在城外的人有什么好处？

Student: what’s the benefit of being an out-of-towner as oppose to being in Wall Street… …(unclear)…

<br>

巴菲特：好吧，相对在华尔街里，做一个在城外的人的好处是什么呢？我在华尔街工作过一段时间。我在美国的东岸西岸都有好友。我喜欢去见他们。当我有什么想法时，我会去见他们。但进行投资决策的最好方式在一个没有其他人的房间里面思考。如果这样都行不通，那么没有什么方法能行得通了。身处任何一种市场型的环境里的缺点是，华尔街是一个极端的例子，就是你会被过度刺激。你会认为你每天必须得做点什么。

Buffett: Well, what’s the benefit of being an out-of-towner as opposed to being in the Wall Street? I worked in the Wall Street for a couple of years. I like…I got my best friends are, actually, on both coasts. I like seeing them. When I got I ideas, I will go there. The best way to think about investment is to be in a room with no one else and just think. If that doesn’t work, nothing else is gonna work. The disadvantage of being in any kinds of market-type environment, the Wall Street will be the extreme, is you will get overstimulated. You will think you have to do something every day. 

<br>

我的意思是，钱德勒家族为这个公司支付了2000美金（巴菲特举起身旁的可乐）。然后你并不需要做其他的事情了，不是吗？你持有几个股票就够了。投资的技巧在于别做其他事情。甚至在1919年都别卖，实际上钱德勒家族后来是抛售了股份了。你要寻找的是一个能让你每年获得一个投资想法的方式，并且将这个想法发挥大最大值。这在一个人们每5分钟就互相叫嚷着价格，不停地将研究报告塞到你面前，之类的环境里非常难办到。华尔街通过交易赚钱。你通过不交易来赚钱，你明白吗？我的意思是，如果在座的每一个人都开始每天互相交易各自的投资组合，你们最后都会破产的。然而证券中介会拿到所有的钱。另一方面，如果你们都选了一组具有代表性的公司，然后坐着等个50年。你最终会有不少的财富，而你的证券中介会破产。他们就像薪酬和病人改变药物品种的频率挂钩的医生。如果这个医生给你一片药，治好你余生所有的病，他只能做到一次销售，一笔交易。就是如此。但是如果他能说服你，每天换药能够让你非常健康，那对于他这个开处方的人来说棒极了，你会花不少钱，但你并不会变的更健康。从财务上，你的生活会越来越差。

I mean, the Chandler family paid 2,000 bucks for this company (Buffett shows his bottle of Coke). You don’t have to do much else, do you? Just pick one of those. The trick is to not do anything else. Even not to sell it in 1919， which the family did later on. What you are looking for is a way to get one good idea a year and then ride it to its full potential. That’s very hard to do with an environment where people are shouting prices back and forth every 5 minutes and shoving reports under your nose and all that. Wall Street makes its money on activity. You make your money on inactivity, you know. I mean, everybody in this room trade their portfolio around every day with every other person, you know, you all are gonna end up broke. The intermediaries will end up with all the money. On the other hand, if you all on a group of average businesses and just sit there for the next 50 years. You will end up with a fair amount of money and your broker will be broke. His activity is…he is like a doctor get paid on how often you get to change pills, I mean, basically. If he gives you one pill and cures you for the rest of your life, he has got one sale, one transaction. That’s it. But if he can convince you that changing pills every day is the way to great health, it will be great for him to be a prescriptionist and you will be out of a lot of money and you won’t be any healthier. You will be a lot worse off financially. 

<br>

你应该避开任何会刺激交易的环境。华尔街有这样的影响力。当我不得不去华尔街，我大概每6个月去一次，去之前会写好一个待办事项和公司访问的清单。我会让我在往返途中花费的路费花的值得的，然后我会回到奥马哈，继续思考投资。

You want to stay away from any environment that stimulates activities. Wall Street will have the effect of doing that. I would…I use…when I have go, I go back about once every 6 months. I will go back with a whole list of things I want to check out or companies I want to see. I will get my money’s worth out of those trips but then I will go back to Omaha and think about it.

### 伯克希尔哈撒韦不发股息（54:15 – 56:20）

巴菲特：好的！（巴菲特点名让对方提问）

Warren Buffett: Yep!

<br>

学生：如何向那些不向股东派发股息的公司估值，比如微软和伯克希尔哈撒韦？

Student: How should investors evaluate ownership of Berkshire Hathaway or Microsoft, if they don’t pay dividends to their investors? 

<br>

巴菲特：好的，问题是关于伯克希尔哈撒韦，问题是如何给伯克希尔哈撒韦估值，而它本身不发股息。它将来也不会发股息的。这是我的承诺。（学生大笑）你在伯克希尔能做的，就是你会得到一个保险箱。每年你能爱抚一番。你可以把钱拿出来然后放回去。这里有极大的心里上的满足，你不可忽略。（学生大笑）

Warren Buffett: Well…the question with Berkshire Hathaway, the question is about evaluating Berkshire when it doesn’t pay any dividends. It won’t pay any dividends either. It’s a promise I can keep. All you get with Berkshire, you still get your safe-deposit box. Every year you can fondle it, you know. You take it out and put it back. I mean, there is an enormous psychic reward in that. You don’t underestimate it.

<br>

真正的问题是，我们是否能将留下来的每一张一元钞票以合理的速度变成更多的一元钞票。这是我们努力在做的。为此查理芒格和我甚至都把自己的钱投进去了。这是我们能获得报酬的唯一方式。我们没有股权，我们没有薪水。我们不从中拿任何东西。我们共用那架私人飞机。这是我们努力在做的。随着时间，这越来越难了。我们管理的钱越多，增长越难。我们会做的远比现在好，如果伯克希尔只有现在的1/100。伯克希尔是完全为股东服务的，但不会派发股息。因为，目前为止，我们留下的本可能会派发的每一美元，我们都将它变成了更多的美元。把钱留下价值会更高。派发股息不是一件聪明事，即使每个人都不需要为此交税。这将会是个错误，如果我们派发了股息，因为目前留下的每一美元都在产生复利。没有办法保证未来会发生。某一刻这会走到尽头。但是这是目标。我的意思是，这是这公司的存在意义。除了提供收益，这公司没有别的事情需要做，我们不会因为总部的大小或者，你懂的，在总部工作的人数多寡不是我们的目的。我们总部有12个人，我们有4万5千雇员。那12个人，3500平方英尺（325平方米）的总部未来也不会变得。我们的目标是公司的业绩。这是我们唯一能获得收入的方式。但是相信我，现在增长比以前难得多了。

The real question is whether we can keep retaining dollar bills and turning them into more than a dollar at a decent rate. That’s we try to do. Charlie Munger and I all have our money in to do that. That’s all we will get paid for doing it. We won’t take any options. We won’t take any salaries. We don’t pick up anything. We ride around the plane. That’s what we are trying to do. It gets harder all the time. The more money we manage the harder it is to do that. We would do way better percentage wise with Berkshire if it is 1/100 the present size. It is run for its owners. But it isn’t run to give them dividend. Because, so far, every dollar that we’ve earned and could have paid out, we have turned into more than a dollar. It worth more than a dollar to keep it. It would be silly to pay out, even if everybody is tax-free to own it. It would have been a mistake to pay dividends of Berkshire because so far the dollar bills retained have turned into more than a dollar. There is no guarantee that that will happen in the future. At some point the game runs out on that. But it’s the goal. I mean, that’s what the business is about. We are not…nothing else about the business do we judge ourselves by. We don’t judge by the size of the home office building or, you know, anything of the number of people working around it. We got 12 people at headquarters, we got 45,000 employees at Berkshire. 12 people at headquarter, 3,500 square feet and we won’t change it. We will judge ourselves by the performance of the company. That’s the only way we will get paid. But, believe me, it is a lot harder than it used to be. 

<br>

### 卖出的时机：最好的持有时间是永远（56:20 – 58:50）

巴菲特：坐在最后方有没有需要提问的？因为我想知道我没有漏掉最后面的那些问题。好的我们将…最远方的那个…怎么样？

Warren Buffett: Anything way in the back because I want to make sure then I’m not missing people back there that haven’t called. Ok, then we will go to the…how about way over there, on the…

<br>

学生：你是如何决定投资已经获得足够的收益？

Student: What makes you decided that investment reaches its full potential?

<br>

巴菲特：我没听见…我是如何决定投资的什么？

Warren Buffett: I missed the…what makes me decide to invest what?

<br>

学生：投资。你的投资在什么时候会达到完全的收益？在你之前说的，你讲…

Student: Investment. When will your investment have reached its full potential? As you said earlier that you will…

<br>

巴菲特：我没听见最后一部分…

Warren Buffett: I missed the last part…

<br>

另一个人帮着重复了问题：你是如何决定投资已经获得足够的收益？

Someone else helped repeat the question: What makes you decided that investment reaches its full potential?

<br>

巴菲特：噢，达到完全收益。好吧…理想情况下你在买下公司的时候你的想法是它永远不会…我的意思是，我从不考虑…在我买可乐的时候我不会想10年，15年后他的生意会走到尽头。它，我的意思是，它有可能发生这样的情况，但是我认为这样的可能性几乎为零。我们真的想做的是买下我们愿意永久持有的公司。这在我看待那些买伯克希尔股票的人是一样的想法。我想人们买下伯克希尔并永久持有。可能因为这样或者那样的原因中途放弃。但是我希望他们，至少在买入的那个时刻，他们的想法是将其持有到永远。我不是说这是买股票的唯一方式。我只是希望愿意和我作伴的人是这样的。因为我不想有一个不停变化的股东群体。我考量伯克希尔的表现是通过观察流动性是能有多么低。如果我有一个教堂，我是那个传教士，每个周日，一半的人都会被换掉，我不会说：“噢这棒极了，我的成员流动性真大啊！这美好的流动！”（学生大笑）你知道的，我会…我会宁愿有一个每个周日所有座位都是坐着一样的人的教堂。好吧，这就是我们看待我们要买的公司的方式。我们想买那些我们愿意永远持有的公司。我们找不到很多这样的公司。

Warren Buffett: Oh, reaches its full potential. Well…ideally you are buying businesses when you feel that it will never happen in terms of… I mean, I don’t think…I don’t buy Coke with the idea that it’s going to out of gas in 10 years, you know, or 15 years. It, I mean, it could be something happen but I would think the chances of that are almost null. What we really want to do is buy businesses that we would be happy to own forever. It’s the same way I feel about people buying Berkshire. I want people to buy Berkshire then plan to hold forever. They may not, for one reason or another. But I want them, at the time they buy it, to think they are buying a business that they are gonna hold forever. I don’t say that’s the only way to buy things. It’s just that that’s the group I want to have joined me. Because I don’t want to have a changing group all the time. I measure Berkshire by how little activities there is in it. If I have a church and I was the preacher, half the congregation left every Sunday, I wouldn’t say: “Oh this is marvelous, I gonna have all this liquidity among my members! This terrific turnover!” You know, I would…I would rather get a church where all the seats are filled with, you know, every Sunday, by the same people. Well, that’s the way we look at the businesses we buy. We want to buy something that we are really happy to own virtually forever. We can’t find a lot of those. 

<br>

当我开始的时候，我的想法远比我的钱多。我只能不断地卖出那个最不那么好的股票，然后买入那个账目价值更便宜的。但是这在现在不会是问题了。所以我们希望我们在买公司的时候，5年后我们依然能像今天那样喜欢。如果我们真是遇到了特大的并购机会，你懂的，我们可能得卖出一些股票了。但这是一个听起来不错的麻烦。在我们买入什么的时候我们不会考虑应该买入的价格。我们不会在我们能以30美金每股买入的时候考虑“如果有人提出40我们就会卖给他”，或者50,60,100。我们只是不那么做了。在我们买入非上市公司比如，2千5百万购入喜诗糖果的时候，我们不会对自己说，如果我们遇到有人愿意出5千万我们就卖了。这真不是我们思考投资的方式。我们分析公司的时候我们会想：“这个公司是否会随着时间持续的提供更多更多更多的现金？”如果答案是“是”，那么我们不需要问别的问题了。

When I started, I had way more ideas than money. I was just constantly having to sell what I thought was the least attractive stock in order to buy something that I just discovered the book value even cheaper. But that’s not the problem really now. So we hope we are buying businesses that we are just as happy with it five years from now as now. If we ever find some huge acquisition, you know, we have to sell something, maybe, to make that acquisition. But that would be a very pleasant problem to have. We never buy something with a price target in mind. We never buy something at 30, saying “If it goes to 40 we will sell it”, or 50, or 60, or 100. We just don’t do it that way any more than… when we buy a private business like Cee’s Candy for 25 million, we don’t say to ourselves if we ever…if we ever get an offer 50 million for this business we will sell it. That’s just not the way we look at the business. We look at the businesses, “Is this going to keep producing more and more and more money over time?” If the answer to that is “Yes,” you don’t need to ask any more questions. 

### 为什么当初投资了像所罗门和长期资本管理这样的公司（58:50 – 1:02:00）

巴菲特：这里有一个…是的，在最后面

Warren Buffett: There is…yeah, way back there. 

<br>

学生：用刚刚提到的原则，你为什么会，比如说所罗门，或者相似的，长期资本管理公司，你是如何对他们估值…

Student: With this same principle in mind, what would it be for, take the case of Salomon, and similarly, for Long Term Capital…how do you quote the evaluation…

<br>

巴菲特：好吧，所罗门，像我之前说的。我当时买入是因为它的证券在1987年提供了9%的回报率，1987年9月的时候。我们当时卖掉了很多股票，然后我有很多现金我没…当时看起来像是我们找不到机会做点什么投资了。所以我选择了一个挺诱人的证券，尽管相应的公司是我永远不会买它的股票的。我买的原因如此。我认为这是一个错误。当时还算不错。但是那不应该是我要做的。我应该，在当时，等个一年然后买可口可乐的股票或者类似的。我们本应该在那时的价格买入可口可乐。尽管那不是很便宜的价格。那是我的错误。对于长期资本管理公司，那是一个…我们在此之前了解很多这类和证券有关的投资模式。其中之一就是套利。我的意思是，我在过去的45年我一直都有做过套利。格雷厄姆大概在这之前的30年也做过。这是一种投资方式。但是不幸的是，我得待在电话旁边，因为我得…我得离开我得办公室了。因为那需要更多的关注市场动态。我不再想做这种事情了，除非真的有一个很好的机会摆在眼前，然后我清楚了解这是什么。我将来不会做很多这样的事了。但我们…在我一生大概做过300场不同的套利，或者更多吧。这是一个很好的投资方式，非常不错的投资。

Warren Buffett: Well, Salomon, like I said, I went into that because it was 9% security in 1987, September 1987, the Dow was up 35% that year. We had sold a lot of stuff, and I had a lot of money around I don’t…it looked like to me that we are never getting any chance to do anything. So I took an attractive security form in a business I would never buy the common stock of it. I went in because of that. I think that’s generally a mistake. It worked out OK finally on that. But it…it’s not what I should have been doing. I should have…we should have waited, in which case, I could have bought more Coca-Cola a year later or thereabout. We should have bought Coke at the prices they were selling at. Even though it wasn’t selling at a pretty price at the time. That was a mistake. At Long Term Capital, that’s…we have learned other businesses that are associated with securities over the years. One of them is arbitrage. I have done arbitrage for 45 years. Graham did it probably 30 years before that. That’s a business. Unfortunately, I have to be near a phone, for I have to…I have to really run out of the office myself. Because it requires being more sort of market-attuned. I don’t want to do that anymore so I…unless a really big arbitrage situation came along and I understood. I won’t be doing much of that. But we… I have probably been in 300 arbitrage situations at least in my life, or maybe more. It’s a good business. Perfectly good business. 

<br>

长期资本管理做着一系列的投资。他们的投资种类繁多，但是最大的那10笔投资，大概其中90%的钱是在冒险的。我对这10笔投资有所了解。从大层面来看，他们公司我不是每一方面都懂。但是我在能看懂，并且我觉得还可，买入价格实惠，并且我们能接受损失的时候我会参与。我们可能会在其中遇到损失。但是我们处于有利位置。这是一个我能懂的游戏。还有些别的我们只是简单的买了一些，没买太多因为不能买太多。但他们涉及到了…他们可以涉及到利率曲线关系，新发行旧发行的国债等等。那些都是你如果在证券行业停留足够长一段时间会明白的东西。但是这不是我们公司的主营。这些交易大概占据了我们每年0.5%的收益，或者0.75%的年收益。他们是一点小小的附赠，如果你只要在证券行业呆一段时间就会学到的那一点儿知识的奖励。

Long Term Capital has a bunch of positions. They had got tons of positions but the top 10 are probably 90% of the money that’s at risk. I know something about those ten position. I don’t know everything about them by a long shot. But I know enough where I would feel OK at a big discount going in and we would have the staying power to hold it out. We might lose money on something like that. But the odds are with us. That’s a game that I understand. There are a few other positions we have that aren’t that big because they can’t get that big. But they involve… they could involve yield curve relationships…or on-the-run, off-the-run government, or things like that. They are just things you have learned over time if you are around securities market. They are not the base of our business. Probably on average, they have accounted for 0.5% our return a year…or 0.75% a year of our return. They are little pluses that you will get for…for actually having just been around a long time and learning a little bit about them. 

<br>

我的第一个套利…不算是第一笔…算是最早的那几笔套利，是和咖啡豆有关的。有个公司愿意用咖啡豆购回他们的股票。那是1955年。我从市场上购入股票，换成库存的咖啡豆，然后开一份仓库的储存票据。因为在咖啡豆交易所，他们想要的另一种形式的票据。当时有0.01%套利利润。我最爱了！我最后终于咖啡豆都卖了。我的意思是，这些都是一些如果你在这个行业待一段时间就会学会的东西。但是我从此就没在遇到过这样的咖啡豆生意了。40多年了我一直在等第二笔。（学生大笑）但还是没等到。但是我还是记得很清楚。长期资本管理公司吧，就是在大规模做着这样的事。

The first arbitrage…not the first arbitrage…but one of the first arbitrage I did involved the company where you…they were offering cocoa beans in exchange for their stocks. That was in 1955. I bought this stock, turned into the stock, got warehouse certificates for cocoa beans. They had to be a different type that were trading in the cocoa exchange. But there was a basis differential. My favorite! I sold them. I mean, that’s just something that I was around at the time so I learned about it. It haven’t been a cocoa bean deal ever since. 40 odd years I have been waiting for another cocoa bean deal. I haven’t seen it. But it’s there in my memory whenever it comes along. And that…Long Term Capital is that on a big scale. 

<br>

### 想要非常高的回报：同时投资6个公司足矣（1:02:00 – 1:04:05）

巴菲特：好的!（巴菲特点名让学生提问）

Warren: Yeah! (Buffett lets one of student audience to ask a question)

<br>

学生：你说过投资需要… （听不清）… 涉及… （听不清）… 分散化… （听不清）…

Student: You basically build an investment… (unclear)… know… (unclear)… involve… (unclear)… diversification… (unclear)…

<br>

巴菲特：问题是关于分散化。我有两个答案。如果你不是专业的投资者，你的目标不是远比这个世界的其他人做的好，那我觉得应该做到极度分散化。我的意思是，我相信98%，99%，或者比99%更多的投资者应该大量分散化并且别频繁交易。这样就意味着低花费的投资指数类投资。因为这些指数做的就是拥有着美国的一部分，这样的想法是合理的。我不会否定。这是他们应该做的，除非他们想要更投入的进行投资，开始进行公司的分析。一旦你开始进行公司的分析，并且决定将投入努力，强度，时间将其做好，那么我觉得任何程度的分散化投资都是糟糕的错误。

Warren Buffett: The question is about diversification. I have got a dual answer to that. If you are not a professional investor, if you goal is not to manage money in such a way to get significantly better return than the world, then I believe in extreme diversification. I mean, I believe 98% or 99%, maybe more than 99% of people who invest should extensively diversify and not trade. That leads to them an index fund type of a decision with very low cost. Because all they are going to do is to own a part of America and they have made a decision that owning a part of America is worthwhile. I don’t quarrel with that at all. That the way they should approach it unless they want to bring in intensity to the game, to make a decision and start evaluating businesses. But once you are in the businesses of evaluating businesses and you decided that you are going to bring the effort, intensity, time involved to get that job done, then I think that diversification is a terrible mistake at any degree. 

<br>

前些日子我在太阳信托银行的时候也有人问我这样的问题。如果你真的要做到了解公司，你大概不会看懂超过6家公司。我的意思是，如果你能找到那6家优秀的公司，这是你全部的分散化。你会因此赚很多的钱，而且我保证你，当你开始投资第7家，你还不如将钱投在第一家你喜欢的公司。此时分散化投资是一个糟糕的错误。极少人能在第七好的点子上致富。但是很多人在他最好的点子上致富。我会说任何一个有一定量的资金的投资人，如果确切明白投资是什么样的事情，懂6家公司很多了。我大概真正喜欢的公司只有3家。

I got asked the question when I was at the SunTrust the other day. If you really know businesses, you probably shouldn’t know more than 6 of them. I mean, if you can identify 6 wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. You can make a lot of money and I will guarantee you that going into a 7th one is going to…you rather putting more money in your first one. It’s gotta be a terrible mistake. Very few people have gotten rich on their 7th best idea. But, a hell lot of people got rich on their best idea. I would say that for anybody working with normal capital who really knows the businesses that they have gone into, a 6 is plenty. I probably have half of it what I like the best. 

<br>

我个人不分散化投资。我知道的优秀的投资者都不分散化 —— 除了我之前提到的沃尔特·施洛斯（价值投资者，巴菲特的朋友，沃尔特·施洛斯有限合伙公司的创始人）。沃尔特·施洛斯做到了相当的分散化。他所有行业都会持有一点。我称这是诺亚（圣经中的人物，曾建造一艘巨船，为了让动物免于洪水之灾而灭绝，各种动物都装载了几个。）你知道的，就是每个行业都挑两个公司持有。（学生大笑）

I don’t diversify, personally. All the people I know that have done well – with the exception we have mentioned Walter Schloss earlier. Walter Schloss diversifies a lot. He owns a little of everything. I call it Noah. You know, you have got two of everything. 

<br>

### 保洁公司和可口可乐：我喜欢保洁，但更喜欢可口可乐的可预测性（1:04:05 – 1:05:45）

巴菲特：好的!（巴菲特点名让学生提问）

Warren: Yeah! (Buffett lets one of student audience to ask a question)

<br>

学生：你是如何区分可口可乐这样的公司以及保洁这样的公司？

Student: How to do differentiate the Coca-Cola of the world and Procter & Gamble of the world?

<br>

巴菲特：好吧，保洁是一个非常好的公司。强大的分销能力，许多名牌，和各种其他的。但是如果你问我，如果现在需要将我全家人的净值投资一个公司，并且从此以后必须离开股市20年，我会选保洁还是可口可乐？实际上，保洁的产品线更加分散化。但是我对可乐比保洁更有信心。但如果有人告诉我我必须持有保洁的股票20年，我并不会不满意。它在我的备选名单里排在前5%，因为这个公司很难被击败。

Warren: Well, Procter & Gamble is good… a very very good business. Strong distribution capability, lots of brand name, and everything. But if you ask me, if I’m going to be away for 20 years, put all my family’s net worth in one business. Whatever Procter & Gamble or Coke? Actually, Procter & Gamble are a little more…be more diversified among product lines. But I would feel sure of Coke than Procter & Gamble. I wouldn’t be unhappy if somebody told me I have to own Procter & Gamble during a 20-year period. That would be in my top 5% because they are not going to get killed. 

<br>

但是相比保洁，我对可乐未来20,30年的单位增长率更有信心。

But, I would feel better about the unit growth and pricing power of Coke over a 20 or 30 years than I would about Procter & Gamble. Right now the pricing power might be tough. But if you think about a billion serving a day, an extra penny means $10 million a day, you know. We own 8% of it, that’s $800,000 a day for Berkshire Hathaway, if you get another penny out of this stuff. Doesn’t seem impossible, does it? I mean, it worth another penny with it. Right now it would be a mistake to try to get it in most market. But overtime, Coke will make more per serving than it does now. 20 years from now I will guarantee you it will more per serving. It will be selling a whole lot more serving. I don’t know how many of them or how much more, but I know that. 

P&G’s main products, I don’t think they have the kind of dominance and they don’t have the kind of unit growth. But they are good businesses, you know. I wouldn’t be unhappy if you told me that I have to put my family’s net worth in P&G and that was the only stock I can own. I would, you know…I might prefer other names but there are a hundred other names I would prefer. 

### 如何评价麦当劳（1:05:45 – 1:08:20）

Warren Buffett: Yeah! (Buffett lets one of student audience to ask a question)

学生：你会买麦当劳的股票吗？假设你在买下麦当劳以后的20年不能卖出

Student: What are you going to say about McDonald’s if you’re going away 20 years from now?

<br>

巴菲特：麦当劳…问题是关于如果我必须持有麦当劳20年。麦当劳有许多能让你买它股票的理由。尤其的它海外的市场。我的意思是，他们在海外的地位比美国还好。但是这是一个越来越难做的生意了。人们并不会每天吃麦当劳。对于那些喝可乐的人来说，如果他们今天喝5盎司，明天还可能喝5盎司。快餐生意比这个更难做。但是如果你必须要在快餐业中选一个，这在全球范围内将是一个巨大的市场，那你会选麦当劳。我的意思是，他们有着最好的商业地位。在成年人中，它没办法赢得美味竞赛。在儿童顾客之中它的表现非常不错，成人来说也还行。但是，这并太可能意味着他是必然的胜者。它在近些年进入了一个折扣促销的游戏模式。你们应该还记得大概一年前麦当劳做过的尝试吧。麦当劳越来越依赖这种模式，而不仅仅只是靠产品本身了。我喜欢那些产品因为其自身特点的而受人喜欢的。如果人们买锋速3的原因是他们喜欢锋速3本身，而不是因为买了锋速3会送豆豆公仔，我对于吉利的感觉会更好。你懂的，我认为这样的产品在本质上是更强势的。应该是这样的。

Warren Buffett: McDonald’s…the question is about McDonald’s if I’m going away for 20 years. McDonald’s has got a lot of things going for it. Particularly, abroad, again. I mean their position in abroad and in many countries is stronger relatively than in here. It’s a tougher business over time. People do not want to eat, except for the kids when they are giving away beanie babies or something. People do not want to eat at McDonald’s every day. For people are drinking Coke today, if they drink 5 ounce today, they probably drink 5 tomorrow. The fast food business is tougher than that. But if you have to pick one hand to have in the fast-food industry, which is gonna be a huge business worldwide, you pick McDonald’s. I mean it…they have the strongest position. It doesn’t win taste test, you know, with adults. I mean, it does very well with children, and does fine with adults. But it does… I mean…it is not…it is not like it is a clear winner. It has got into the game in recent years of being more price promotional and, you know, you remember the experiment a year ago or so. And that…so it has got more dependent on that rather than just selling the product by itself. I like product by itself sells. I feel better about Gillette if people buy the Mach 3 because they like the Mach 3 than if they get a beanie baby with it. You know, I mean…so I just think it’s fundamentally a stronger product if that’s the case. You know, it probably is. 

<br>

我们持有吉利许多股份。你知道吗，想到几十亿人脸上的胡须不停的在生长，你在晚上能睡的很好。即使是你在睡觉的时候，胡须也在生长。女人们有两条腿，这更棒了。（学生大笑）所以这比数绵羊还容易入睡。这是就是那类我前面提到的商机。但是如果你需要考虑的是：“下个月我需要推出什么促销项目击败汉堡王”，“如果他们和迪士尼签了合约而我们没有签怎么办” 我希望产品自身能站得住脚，即便是没有促销的帮忙。虽然通过促销你能建立一个很好的公司。麦当劳是一个美妙的公司。但它没有可乐那么好。但是这本身很难做到…这已经是很好的公司了。如果需要在这个行业里面押注某一个公司，除了冰雪皇后——我离题了——你大概会选麦当劳。前不久我们买下了冰雪皇后，这也是为什么我刚刚不知廉耻的广告植入了（学生大笑）。

We own a lot of Gillette. You can sleep pretty well at nights if you think of a couple of billion men with their hair growing on their faces, you know. It is growing all night while you are asleep, you know. Woman have to legs, it’s even better. So it beats counting sheep. Those are the kind of business...but if you are gonna think: “what promotion am I going to put out there to gets Burger King next month”, “what if they sign up with Disney and I don’t get Disney.” I mean…that is…I’m…I like the products that are standalone, in absence of promotional pricing appeals. Although you can build a very good business based on that. McDonald’s is a terrific business. It is not as good businesses as Coke. But that…you know, there are really hard…hardly any…it’s a very good business. If you bet on one company in that field, aside from Dairy Queen – I’m off the question – you might pick McDonald’s. We bought Dairy Queen here awhile back, that’s why I’m plugging it shamelessly here.

<br>

### 对电力和公共事业公司的看法：不知道谁会是赢家（1:08:20 - 1:09:45）

Warren Buffett: Yeah, way back there. 

Student: What do you think of the electric and utility industry?

Warren Buffett: What do I think of what?

Student: Electric and utility industry. 

Warren Buffett: Electric and utility industry? Well…I thought about that a lot. Because you can put big money in it. And I’ve even thought of buying entire businesses. There is a fellow in Omaha actually has done a little of that though CalEnergy. But I don’t quite understand the game in terms of how it is going to develop with the regulations. I mean…it’s…it’s gotta… I can see how it destroys a lot of value for the high-cost producer, once they are not protected by a monopoly territory. And I don’t, quite for sure, see how…who benefits and how much. I mean, obviously, the guy with the very low cost power, some guys got the hydropower you know, 2 cents a kilowatt or something like that. He’s got huge advantage. But how much of that is getting kept or everything? How extensively he can send that outside this natural territory? I haven’t able to figure that out with certainty. 

So I really think I need to know what the industry is going to look like in 10 years. But it is something that I think about. If I have ever developed any insights call for action, you know, I will act on it. Because I think I can understand the attractiveness of the products and it’s…all of that. All the aspects of certainty of user need and the fact that there is a bargain, all of that. I understand. I just don’t understand who is going to make money in it 10 years from now. That keeps me away.

<br>

### 小市值公司似乎比大市值公司表现好：我其实并不在乎市值大小（1:09:45 - 1:11:55）

Warren Buffett: Yep!

Student: What do you think that the market is favoring the large-cap, blue-chip stocks over small-cap stocks? And what helps you view…(unclear)

Warren Buffett: The question is “large cap vs small cap”. And why “large-cap over-perform”. I don’t know the answer to that. We don’t think…we don’t care whether a company is large cap, “gigantic-cap”, middle-cap, small-cap, micro-cap. Doesn’t make any difference. The only question we care about is “can we understand the business”, “do we like the people running it”, “is the business itself and price are attractive.” From my personal stand point running Berkshire now, because we got Pual Former for Gen Re. I don’t know what we have, maybe 75 or 80 billion dollars to invest. And I only want to invest in about 5 things. So I’m really very limited to very big companies. But if I were to invest in 100,000 dollars, I wouldn’t care whether something is large cap or small cap or anything. I would just look for businesses I understood. Now… I think, on balance, large cap companies as businesses have done extraordinary well in the last 10 years and way better than people anticipated they would do. I mean you really have American businesses earning close to something 20% on equity. That’s something that nobody had dreamt about. That’s being produced by very large companies in aggregate. So you have this huge evaluation upward of in… because of lower interest rate and much higher return on capital. You know, if American businesses are really bonds, disguised bonds that earn 20% – have 20% coupon – much better than the bonds that earn 13% coupon. That’s happening with big companies in recent years. Whether it is permanent or not is another question. I’m skeptical of that. But I don’t… I wouldn’t even think about… except for the question “how much money we run” … I wouldn’t even think about the size of businesses. 

A good one, Cee’s Candy was a 25 million dollars’ business when we bought it. I mean if I can find one that is just like it now, if it is the biggest we’ve found, you know, I got to buy it. It is the certainty of it that counts.

### 关于房地产：能找到的投资机会并不多（1:11:55 - 1:16:05）

Warren Buffett: Yeah, way over there!

Student: I mentioned earlier that buying stocks in service companies or policy companies. Once a while, until the last five years, the real estate has been primarily private.  …(unclear)…securitization of real estate. I wonder what is your insight into the industry. 

Warren Buffett: Yeah… you talk about the real estate… I mean securitization. Normally securitization of … of … the debt too … the real estate. That is one of the items right now that is really clogging up the capital market. I mean, the mortgage-backed securities are… they are just not moving in commercial mortgage-back, not residential mortgage-back. So that… but I think that you are directing you question at equity probably. 

The equities… if you leave out… the corporate form has been a lousy way to own equities, I mean. You interject the corporate income tax. That isn’t something when people individually have been able to own with a single tax. By having the normal corporate form, you get to have a double taxation. You really don’t need it with real estate. It takes away too much rate of return. REITs have in effect created a conduit so you don’t get the double taxation. But they also generally have fairly high operating expenses. If you get real estate, let’s just say you can buy fairly simple type of real estate at an 8% yield thereabouts. And you take away maybe close to 1 or maybe 1.5% by the time you count stock options and everything. It’s not a terribly attractive way to own. Maybe the only way a guy with a thousand bucks or 5 thousand bucks can own it. But if you have a million dollars, or 10 million dollars, you are better off owning a real estate property yourself. You are saving some intermediaries in-between, who will get a sizable piece of return for themselves. 

We have found very little in that field. You will see an announcement in the next couple in the next couple weeks that I may belie what I’m telling you. I don’t want you to think … I don’t want you to think I was double-crossing up here (Buffett giggled). But generally speaking, we have seemed very very little in that field that gets us excited. People sometimes get very confused about… they will look at some huge land companies. I will take one that you won’t get emotional reaction on the parts of it. Texas Pacific Land Trust, which has been around for over 100 years. They have got a couple acres of Taxes. They will take the… they sold 1% of their land every year. They will take that as a plying and everything and come up with some huge value compared to the market value. But that’s nonsense if you really own the property. You can’t move 50% of the property or 20% of the property. It is way worse than owing liquid stocks. So you get these… I think you get these silly evaluation placed on a lot of real estate companies by people who really don’t understand what is it like to own one and try to move large quantity of property. 

REITs behave terribly in the market this year as you know. And it is not all unconceivable that they will become a class… they will get so unpopular that they will sell at significant discounts from which you can sell the properties for. They can get interesting as a class but then the question is “would the management will fight you in the process”. Because they will be giving up their income stream for managing things. Their interests may run counter to the show or some of that. I always wonder about the REITs that say, you know, “our assets are so wonderful, they are so cheap.” And they go out and sell stocks. There is a contradiction to that. They say “a stock at 28 is very cheap” and they sell a lot of stocks at 28 less underwriting commission. There is, you know, they either… there is a disconnect there. 

But it’s a field we look at. I mean, Charlie and I can understand real estate. And we will be open for very big transactions periodically. If there is a “Long Term Capital Management” situation translated to real estate, we will be open to that. The trouble is many other people will be too. They will be unlikely to go to a price that would really get us excited. 

<br>

### 股市不在乎你的想法（1:16:05 – 1:18:45）

Warren Buffett: Way back there.

Student: My understanding of your theory is that, sort of, down market is terrific for net savers. Can you sort of get into your thought about whether the market is going upward or downward or stagnant, long term profits and short term profits … (unclear)?

Warren Buffett: Well, yeah, I have got… I have got no idea where the market is gonna go. I prefer it is going down. I haven’t… my preferences have nothing to do with it. The market knows nothing about my feelings. That is one of the first thing you have to learn with the stocks. If you buy 100 shares of General Motors, all out of the sudden you have this feeling about General Motors. I mean, if it goes down you may be mad at it, you may say “well, if it just goes to what I had paid for, my life will be wonderful again.” Or if it goes up you may say how smart you were, how you and General Motors have this love affair. I mean, you got all these feeling. Stock doesn’t know you own it. Stock just sits there, it doesn’t care what you paid, doesn’t care if you own it, or anything. So any feelings I have about the market is not reciprocated. It is the ultimate… it is a very cold shoulder we are talking about here. 

Anybody in this room, let’s say, practically everybody in this room is more likely to be a net buyer of the stocks over the next 10 years than a net seller. So everyone of you should prefer lower prices. I mean if you are going to be a net eater of hamburger the next 10 years, you want hamburger to go down unless you are cattle producer. If you are going to be a buyer of Coca-Cola and you don’t own Coke stock, you hope the price of Coke goes down. You are looking for it to be on sale this weekend when you are in the supermarket, you want it go down in the weekends not up in the weekends when you gonna tend the supermarket. 

<br>

纽约证券交易所是一个公司的百货商场。如果你想去这里买股票，你会期待什么？你希望这些股票的价格都打折，越便宜越好。这样一来你能买很多股票。再后来，20年以后，30年以后，你处在一个开始利用起你的这些储蓄，或者你的后代开始使用你的储蓄的阶段（学生大笑），然后你会考虑更高的股价。这是在本格雷厄姆的《聪明的投资者》的第八章提到的，关于对股市波动的态度。这一章还有第20章“安全边际”，在我看来，是投资领域有史以来最好的两篇文章。因为当我在18岁读到第8章时，我就懂了，显而易懂，但是我没办法自己领悟。这是那一章解释给我的道理。我如果未曾读到那篇文章，我大概还需要花100年去明白这个道理。我依然会认为，股票上涨就是一个好事。

New York Stock Exchange is a big supermarket of companies. You are going to buying stocks. What do you want it to happen? You want those stocks to go down, way down. And you will make better buys then. Later on, 20 years from now, 30 years from now, you are in the period when you dis-saving, or lairs dis-saving for you then you got… I mean, then you may care about higher prices. But I find people… that was one of the… that’s chapter 8 in Ben Graham’s “intelligent investor” about the attitude toward stock market fluctuations. That and chapter 20 on the “margin of safety” are the two most important essays ever written on investing as far as I concern. Because when I read chapter 8 when I was 18, I figured, you know, I just figured out what I just said but… it is obvious, but I didn’t figure out myself though. It was explained to me. I probably would have gone another 100 years if I hadn’t  read it. I would still thought it was good when my stocks were going up. 

<br>

我们都希望股市能下跌一些，但是我对未来股市的动向并不了解。我一直以来都没有答案，未来也不会。如果股市下跌了，我买股的时候会更仔细些，因为我知道更有机会出现投资机会。我花的钱会更加值。

We want things to go down but I have no idea about what the stock market is gonna do. I never do. I will never will. It is not something that I think about at all. When it goes down I feel… I look harder when I might buy that day because I know there is more likely to be some merchandise there. I can use my money effectively.

<p class="small">来源：伯克希尔哈撒韦公司网站 <https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/owners.html> </p>
<p class="small">原文标题：BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. AN OWNER'S MANUAL</p>

*译者注：在伯克希尔哈撒韦的官方网站上（www.berkshirehathaway.com），有一份叫做股东手册（Owner Manual）的PDF可供任何人免费下载。说明性文件难免充满繁文缛节。不过巴菲特在其中穿插的一些小幽默使得整篇文件不至于枯燥无味。*

<br>

1996年6月，伯克希尔的主席，沃伦·爱德华·巴菲特面向A级股和B级股股东发布了名为“股东手册”的小手册。手册的目的是解释伯克希尔的基本经营投资原则。以下是一份修正并补充后的新版本。
In June 1996, Berkshire’s Chairman, Warren E. Buffett, issued a booklet entitled “An Owner’s Manual*” to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B shareholders. The purpose of the manual was to explain Berkshire’s broad economic principles of operation. An updated version is reproduced on this and the following pages.

\* Copyright © 1996 By Warren E. Buffett, All Rights Reserved

<br>

## 股东相关的商业原则OWNER-RELATED BUSINESS PRINCIPLES

在1983年当我们收购蓝筹印花时，我写下了13条股东相关的商业原则，目的是为了让新股东了解我们的管理方法。正如名字所提到的“原则”，这13条在如今依然有效，并且将在这里以斜体字标明。

At the time of the Blue Chip merger in 1983, I set down 13 owner-related business principles that I thought would help new shareholders understand our managerial approach. As is appropriate for “principles,” all 13 remain alive and well today, and they are stated here in italics.

<br>

1\. 虽然我们的结构是公司，我们的态度是合伙人制度。查理芒格和我将我们的股东视为有限合伙人，而我们则是一般合伙人。（虽然如果考虑到由于我们的持股比例，我们也是有限合伙人。）我们不将公司本身视为公司资产的最终持有者，而是将公司作为我们的股东持有资产的载体。

1\. Although our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership. Charlie Munger and I think of our shareholders as ownerpartners, and of ourselves as managing partners. (Because of the size of our shareholdings we are also, for better or worse, controlling partners.) We do not view the company itself as the ultimate owner of our business assets but instead view the company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the assets.

<br>

查理和我希望你不会将股票认为是价格不断浮动的一张纸，在某些会让你紧张的经济或者政治事件出现时你就会抛售。我们希望你能够将自己视为公司的永久股东，就像是你和家庭成员共同买入一套公寓或者是一片农场时那样。对于我们而言，我们不会将伯克希尔的股东认为是毫无差别的，不断变化的人群，而是一群共同投资者愿意将会影响他们未来的资金放在我们手中。

Charlie and I hope that you do not think of yourself as merely owning a piece of paper whose price wiggles around daily and that is a candidate for sale when some economic or political event makes you nervous. We hope you instead visualize yourself as a part owner of a business that you expect to stay with indefinitely, much as you might if you owned a farm or apartment house in partnership with members of your family. For our part, we do not view Berkshire shareholders as faceless members of an ever-shifting crowd, but rather as co-venturers who have entrusted their funds to us for what may well turn out to be the remainder of their lives.

<br>

有证据证明大部分的伯克希尔股东都接受了这样的长期合伙的概念。每年的百分比周转率相比于其他大型美国公司的股票来说相当低，即使不考虑我持有的那一部分股份。

The evidence suggests that most Berkshire shareholders have indeed embraced this long-term partnership concept. The annual percentage turnover in Berkshire’s shares is a fraction of that occurring in the stocks of other major American corporations, even when the shares I own are excluded from the calculation.

<br>

在效果上，我们的股东对于伯克希尔股票的处理方式就像是伯克希尔对于她所投资的公司的处理方式一样。比如说，作为可口可乐或者是美国运通的股东，我们认为伯克希尔是这两个优秀公司的有限合伙人。我们衡量我们投资成功的标志是长期以来的公司的进展，而不是每个月的股票价格变动。实际上，即使在未来几年内不允许股票交易，没有股票报价，我们也完全不会在意。如果我们对长期的发展感到乐观，短期的价格变化除了能带给我们以优惠价格追加更多股份的机会以外，对我们来说没有意义。

In effect, our shareholders behave in respect to their Berkshire stock much as Berkshire itself behaves in respect to companies in which it has an investment. As owners of, say, Coca-Cola or American Express shares, we think of Berkshire as being a non-managing partner in two extraordinary businesses, in which we measure our success by the long-term progress of the companies rather than by the month-to-month movements of their stocks. In fact, we would not care in the least if several years went by in which there was no trading, or quotation of prices, in the stocks of those companies. If we have good long-term expectations, short-term price changes are meaningless for us except to the extent they offer us an opportunity to increase our ownership at an attractive price.

<br>

2\. 和伯克希尔股东为导向的理念相契合的是，我们的经理的大部分净值都属于我们旗下公司们的股份。我们和股东站在同一战线上。

2\. In line with Berkshire’s owner-orientation, most of our directors have a major portion of their net worth invested in the company. We eat our own cooking.

<br>

查理家庭的大部分净值属于伯克希尔的股票；我自己则是98%。额外的，我的许多亲戚，我妹妹们和堂表兄弟姐妹，大部分的净值属于伯克希尔股票。

Charlie’s family has the majority of its net worth in Berkshire shares; I have more than 98%. In addition, many of my relatives – my sisters and cousins, for example – keep a huge portion of their net worth in Berkshire stock.

<br>

查理和我对于这种将鸡蛋放在一个篮子里的情况习以为常。我们认为伯克希尔商业质量和多元化有独特优势，无论她涉及的成员公司的持股多寡。

Charlie and I feel totally comfortable with this eggs-in-one-basket situation because Berkshire itself owns a wide variety of truly extraordinary businesses. Indeed, we believe that Berkshire is close to being unique in the quality and diversity of the businesses in which it owns either a controlling interest or a minority interest of significance.

<br>

查理和我无法承诺投资收益。但是我们可以保证你未来的收益和我们会是一样的结果。我们对于丰厚的薪酬或者是股权，或者是从股东身上获益没有兴趣。我们想要赚钱的情况是我们的股东也能按比例获利。更多的，假如我做了某些愚蠢的决定，你们可以从我也在按比例的损失这件事中获得一些心理安慰。

Charlie and I cannot promise you results. But we can guarantee that your financial fortunes will move in lockstep with ours for whatever period of time you elect to be our partner. We have no interest in large salaries or options or other means of gaining an “edge” over you. We want to make money only when our partners do and in exactly the same proportion. Moreover, when I do something dumb, I want you to be able to derive some solace from the fact that my financial suffering is proportional to yours.

<br>

3\. 我们的长期收益目标（存在一些后面会提到的例外情况）是最大化伯克希尔每股的内在商业价值的平均年化收益。我们并不从伯克希尔整体的规模的表现或者是经济影响力考虑，而是着重于每股的变化。我们认为在未来，每股的收益表现会逐渐减弱。当管理的资金额度增加时，这种情况会浮现。但是，我们觉得如果未能超出美国大型企业的收益平均值是一件令人失望的事情。

3\. Our long-term economic goal (subject to some qualifications mentioned later) is to maximize Berkshire’s average annual rate of gain in intrinsic business value on a per-share basis. We do not measure the economic significance or performance of Berkshire by its size; we measure by per-share progress. We are certain that the rate of per-share progress will diminish in the future – a greatly enlarged capital base will see to that. But we will be disappointed if our rate does not exceed that of the average large American corporation.

<br>

4\. 我们的首要的投资偏好是直接持有一系列多元化的，能够产生资金并且能持续提供超出美国平均值资本收益率的公司。我们的第二备选是通过我们的保险公司在公开市场上买入拥有这种特性的公司的一部分股票。股票的价格，市场成交量，以及保险公司的资金需求决定着每一年的资产分配情况。

4\. Our preference would be to reach our goal by directly owning a diversified group of businesses that generate cash and consistently earn above-average returns on capital. Our second choice is to own parts of similar businesses, attained primarily through purchases of marketable common stocks by our insurance subsidiaries. The price and availability of businesses and the need for insurance capital determine any given year’s capital allocation.

<br>

在近些年我们进行了一系列的收购。虽然未来有些年份的收购事件不会像现在这么多，我们期望在未来数十年收购的频率会增加，并期望会出现大型的收购事件。如果这些收购的质量能和历史上曾发生过的相似，那么伯克希尔足以能够从此颇为获益。

In recent years we have made a number of acquisitions. Though there will be dry years, we expect to make many more in the decades to come, and our hope is that they will be large. If these purchases approach the quality of those we have made in the past, Berkshire will be well served.

<br>

对于我们的挑战是在我们已经快速产生了现金流之后如何以相同速度找到新的投资想法。在这一点看来，一个表现低迷的股票市场会对我们产生巨大的优势。原因之一，这些时期内完全收购公司的价格会降低。原因之二，低迷的市场能让我们的保险公司以优惠的价格买入优秀的公司的股份，这也包括增持已有的股份。原因之三，历史上，优秀公司一直都是自己的股票的长期买家，这意味着我们能像他们一样都能从低价中受益。

The challenge for us is to generate ideas as rapidly as we generate cash. In this respect, a depressed stock market is likely to present us with significant advantages. For one thing, it tends to reduce the prices at which entire companies become available for purchase. Second, a depressed market makes it easier for our insurance companies to buy small pieces of wonderful businesses – including additional pieces of businesses we already own – at attractive prices. And third, some of those same wonderful businesses are consistent buyers of their own shares, which means that they, and we, gain from the cheaper prices at which they can buy.

<br>

总体来说，伯克希尔和他的长期股东将会从一个低迷的股票市场中收益更多，就像是去超市买食品的人能从折扣中获益。当股市剧跌时 - 而这会经常发生 – 别恐慌或者哀悼。这对伯克希尔是好事。

Overall, Berkshire and its long-term shareholders benefit from a sinking stock market much as a regular purchaser of food benefits from declining food prices. So when the market plummets – as it will from time to time – neither panic nor mourn. It’s good news for Berkshire.

<br>

5\. 因为我们双管齐下的投资策略，以及传统会计方法的限制，合成财务报表的收入可能反映的并不是我们真实的财务表现。查理和我，既是有限合伙人又是一般合伙人，基本上不在意合成财务报表的数据。尽管如此，我们会通报每一个控股的大型的公司的收益。那些我们认为非常重要的数据。这些数据，和其他一系列我们投资的公司的信息，应该能够帮助你了解他们的经营情况。

5\. Because of our two-pronged approach to business ownership and because of the limitations of conventional accounting, consolidated reported earnings may reveal relatively little about our true economic performance. Charlie and I, both as owners and managers, virtually ignore such consolidated numbers. However, we will also report to you the earnings of each major business we control, numbers we consider of great importance. These figures, along with other information we will supply about the individual businesses, should generally aid you in making judgments about them.

<br>

简单来说，我们将会给你那些重要的年报的数据和其他重要数据。查理和我会仔细留意我们的公司的表现，我们也会努力了解每个公司的背后的市场经济情况。比如说，我们的子公司中所处的行业是否出现了利好或利空的情况。查理和我需要了解哪种情况占多数，并且以此调整我们的市场预期。我们也会将我们的结论公布给股东。

To state things simply, we try to give you in the annual report the numbers and other information that really matter. Charlie and I pay a great deal of attention to how well our businesses are doing, and we also work to understand the environment in which each business is operating. For example, is one of our businesses enjoying an industry tailwind or is it facing a headwind? Charlie and I need to know exactly which situation prevails and to adjust our expectations accordingly. We will also pass along our conclusions to you.

<br>

长期来看，绝大部分的子公司的表现都超出了我们的预期。但是有时候我们也会发现一些令人失望的情况，我们会尽可能坦白这些信息，就像我们和你们坦白我们的好消息一样。当我们使用了非传统的计量方法记录我们的进展时 – 比如说，你会在我们的年报中读到关于浮存金的信息 – 我们会尽可能解释这些概念，并且告诉你们为什么这些信息很重要。换一句话说，我们相信，通过告知你们我们的分析方法，你们不仅可以能够评估伯克希尔子公司的质量，而且能够评估我们的管理和资产分配方法。

Over time, the large majority of our businesses have exceeded our expectations. But sometimes we have disappointments, and we will try to be as candid in informing you about those as we are in describing the happier experiences. When we use unconventional measures to chart our progress – for instance, you will be reading in our annual reports about insurance “float” – we will try to explain these concepts and why we regard them as important. In other words, we believe in telling you how we think so that you can evaluate not only Berkshire’s businesses but also assess our approach to management and capital allocation.

<br>

6\. 会计上的结果并不会影响我们的经营或者资产分配的决策。当收购成本是相似的，我们宁愿收购那些，无法被财务报表记录的，但能带来2美元的收益的公司，也不愿意收购那些，能被财务报表记录，但只能带来1美元收益的公司。这其实是我们常常在收购中需要面对的选择题，因为完全收购一家公司（收益能够完全被财务报表记录）比起部分买入时（收益大部分无法被记录）的收购成本要按比例高出一倍。总体来看长期而言，我们期望未计入财务报表的收入能以股票的价格上涨的形式反映在我们的内在价值中。

6\. Accounting consequences do not influence our operating or capital-allocation decisions. When acquisition costs are similar, we much prefer to purchase $2 of earnings that is not reportable by us under standard accounting principles than to purchase $1 of earnings that is reportable. This is precisely the choice that often faces us since entire businesses (whose earnings will be fully reportable) frequently sell for double the pro-rata price of small portions (whose earnings will be largely unreportable). In aggregate and over time, we expect the unreported earnings to be fully reflected in our intrinsic business value through capital gains.

<br>

我们发现长期来看，来自我们的被投资公司的净利润不论是否分配的，从总体上对于伯克希尔都是同样有利的，尽管如果分配到伯克希尔就意味着能够记录在伯克希尔的财务报表中。这样优异的结果源自于我们的大部分被投资公司都是能够将资本完善利用的优秀公司。他们要么将资本用于自身经营，要么用于回购自己的股份。很显然，并不是每一次资本的决策都能有利于作为股东的伯克希尔，但是总体上我们从他们留存收益中获得的收益远高于留存收益本身。我们因此将纸面收益认为是符合事实的年度经营收益反映。

We have found over time that the undistributed earnings of our investees, in aggregate, have been fully as beneficial to Berkshire as if they had been distributed to us (and therefore had been included in the earnings we officially report). This pleasant result has occurred because most of our investees are engaged in truly outstanding businesses that can often employ incremental capital to great advantage, either by putting it to work in their businesses or by repurchasing their shares. Obviously, every capital decision that our investees have made has not benefitted us as shareholders, but overall we have garnered far more than a dollar of value for each dollar they have retained. We consequently regard look-through earnings as realistically portraying our yearly gain from operations.

<br>

7\. 我们不常举债，但当我们确实需要贷款时，我们尝试着使用长期，固定息票利率的债券。我们宁愿错失机会也不想过度使用杠杆。这种保守的投资方式对我们的收益产生了一定影响，但是这是我们唯一能够接受的方式。这是考虑到了我们对于保险客户，债权人，以及投入大量资本的股东的代理人义务（一位印第安纳波利斯500英里比赛的冠军车手曾说过：“想要第一个到达终点，第一你必须得到达终点”）

7\. We use debt sparingly and, when we do borrow, we attempt to structure our loans on a long-term fixed-rate basis. We will reject interesting opportunities rather than over-leverage our balance sheet. This conservatism has penalized our results but it is the only behavior that leaves us comfortable, considering our fiduciary obligations to policyholders, lenders and the many equity holders who have committed unusually large portions of their net worth to our care. (As one of the Indianapolis “500” winners said: “To finish first, you must first finish.”)

<br>

查理和我使用的投资策略使得我们并不会牺牲睡眠质量而获得高上几个百分比的收益。我从不愿意冒着失去我家人和朋友所需要的事物的风险而争取他们并不需要的。

The financial calculus that Charlie and I employ would never permit our trading a good night’s sleep for a shot at a few extra percentage points of return. I’ve never believed in risking what my family and friends have and need in order to pursue what they don’t have and don’t need.

<br>

此外，伯克希尔有两个低成本低风险的融资渠道来形成财务杠杆，用以持有远比我们的权益资本更高的资产：递延所得税和保险浮存金。保险浮存金是我们的保险公司暂存的客户的资金，因为保险公司需要预收客户的保金以备未来的索赔。这两个融资渠道一直都在快速的增长，目前总价值已经达到了大约1680亿美金。

Besides, Berkshire has access to two low-cost, non-perilous sources of leverage that allow us to safely own far more assets than our equity capital alone would permit: deferred taxes and “float,” the funds of others that our insurance business holds because it receives premiums before needing to pay out losses. Both of these funding sources have grown rapidly and now total about $168 billion.

<br>

更好的一点是，这些融资到目前为止都是无成本的。递延所得税义务不存在利息。而只要我们能在保险行业做到收支平衡，经营过程的产生浮存金也是无成本的。不过他们两者都不属于权益，而被会计准则记为义务。但是他们都是不存在契约条件或者是截止日期的。在效果上，他们提供了债务般的优势 – 让更多的资产为我们服务的能力 – 但是不存在债务那些令人不快的缺点。

Better yet, this funding to date has often been cost-free. Deferred tax liabilities bear no interest. And as long as we can break even in our insurance underwriting the cost of the float developed from that operation is zero. Neither item, of course, is equity; these are real liabilities. But they are liabilities without covenants or due dates attached to them. In effect, they give us the benefit of debt – an ability to have more assets working for us – but saddle us with none of its drawbacks.

<br>

当然了，这并不意味着我们也能在未来以零成本的方式使用我们的保险浮存金。但是我们认为我们能够使用浮存金的机会和其他保险公司一样多。我们不仅在过去达到了这样的目标（尽管你们的董事长犯下了多次重要的错误），由于我们在1996年对于政府雇员保险公司的收购，我们在未来能够达到这个目标的可能性也很大。

Of course, there is no guarantee that we can obtain our float in the future at no cost. But we feel our chances of attaining that goal are as good as those of anyone in the insurance business. Not only have we reached the goal in the past (despite a number of important mistakes by your Chairman), our 1996 acquisition of GEICO, materially improved our prospects for getting there in the future.

<br>

我们目前的经营方式让我们能够在公共事业以及铁路公司进行使用额外的，不存在追索权的贷款。所以我们将继续倾向于使用长期，固定利率贷款。

In our present configuration we expect additional borrowings to be concentrated in our utilities and railroad businesses, loans that are non-recourse to Berkshire. Here, we will favor long-term, fixed-rate loans.

<br>

8\. 管理层不会做出为满足个人愿望而牺牲股东利益的事情。我们不会以多元化为理由，溢价完全收购对股东们并没有长期收益的公司。我们将你们的资本视为自己的资本，在公开市场上进行多元化投资是出于为你们的投资组合带来附加价值为前提的。

8\. A managerial “wish list” will not be filled at shareholder expense. We will not diversify by purchasing entire businesses at control prices that ignore long-term economic consequences to our shareholders. We will only do with your money what we would do with our own, weighing fully the values you can obtain by diversifying your own portfolios through direct purchases in the stock market.

<br>

查理和我只会收购会增加伯克希尔股票的每股内在价值的公司。我们的工资和伯克希尔的公司规模无关。

Charlie and I are interested only in acquisitions that we believe will raise the per-share intrinsic value of Berkshire’s stock. The size of our paychecks or our offices will never be related to the size of Berkshire’s balance sheet.

<br>

9\. 我们认为重大决策都应该进行周期性的评估。我们评估是否派发股息的标准是，分析我们留存的每一美元是否带来至少一美元的股价变化。在目前为止，伯克希尔能够通过这项测试。我们将在未来持续进行这种对于过去五年的累计业绩评估。虽然，在我们净值不断增加后，能够有效地使用留存收益就变得愈发困难。

9\. We feel noble intentions should be checked periodically against results. We test the wisdom of retaining earnings by assessing whether retention, over time, delivers shareholders at least $1 of market value for each $1 retained. To date, this test has been met. We will continue to apply it on a five-year rolling basis. As our net worth grows, it is more difficult to use retained earnings wisely.

<br>

我应该换一个“过去五年”的说法。这是我一个直到2009年股东大会上遇到一次相关的提问后才意识到的错误。

I should have written the “five-year rolling basis” sentence differently, an error I didn’t realize until I received a question about this subject at the 2009 annual meeting.

<br>

当股市出现连续五年的下跌，有时候我们的股票价格相对于账面价值的溢价会减小。在这种情况出现时，伯克希尔的将无法通过之前提到的检验。实际上，在我1983年写下这些原则之前，在1971-1975年期间，我们的股价曾远低于账面价值。

When the stock market has declined sharply over a five-year stretch, our market-price premium to book value has sometimes shrunk. And when that happens, we fail the test as I improperly formulated it. In fact, we fell far short as early as 1971-75, well before I wrote this principle in 1983.

<br>

五年测试应该是这样：（1）在这段期间内我们的账面价值增长超过了标准普尔的增长，以及（2）我们的股价是否能持续的高出每股账面价值，意味着每1美金的留存收益是否能带来超出1美元的价值？如果这些测试能够满足，不派发股息的行为是合理的。

The five-year test should be: (1) during the period did our book-value gain exceed the performance of the S&P; and (2) did our stock consistently sell at a premium to book, meaning that every $1 of retained earnings was always worth more than $1? If these tests are met, retaining earnings has made sense.

<br>

10\. 我们增发普通股的情况只会是我们能够获得的价值能和我们牺牲的价值一样多。这个法则应用于所有类型的增发 – 不仅包括并购或者公开募股，也包括股债转换，股权，以及可转换证券。如果这一行为无法带来更大的价值，我们不会将公司的部分价值卖给外人 – 在股票增发时这种情况会发生。

10\. We will issue common stock only when we receive as much in business value as we give. This rule applies to all forms of issuance – not only mergers or public stock offerings, but stock-for-debt swaps, stock options, and convertible securities as well. We will not sell small portions of your company – and that is what the issuance of shares amounts to – on a basis inconsistent with the value of the entire enterprise.

<br>

当我们在1996年售出B级股时，我们声明伯克希尔的股票并没有被低估，但是有些人并不相信。但他们本不应该。他们应该在我们的股价被低估的时候对增发感到惊讶。管理层在公开募股的时候明示或者暗示股价被低估，要么是对于事实的不重视或者是对于股东资产的不重视：如果将实际价值1美元的资产以80美分卖出，这对股东来说是一笔不公平的损失。我们在售出B级股的时候没有犯这种错误，在将来我们也不会。（但是，我们也未曾在增发时提到过我们的股票被高估，这些言论来自于很多媒体在报道时的误解。）

When we sold the Class B shares in 1996, we stated that Berkshire stock was not undervalued – and some people found that shocking. That reaction was not well-founded. Shock should have registered instead had we issued shares when our stock was undervalued. Managements that say or imply during a public offering that their stock is undervalued are usually being economical with the truth or uneconomical with their existing shareholders’ money: Owners unfairly lose if their managers deliberately sell assets for 80¢ that in fact are worth $1. We didn’t commit that kind of crime in our offering of Class B shares and we never will. (We did not, however, say at the time of the sale that our stock was overvalued, though many media have reported that we did.)

<br>

11\. 你应该完全注意到了查理和我有着一种对于投资收益表现不利的投资态度：不管别人给出怎么样的价格，我们对于伯克希尔持有的绩优公司都没有卖出的打算。我们也非常不愿意卖出表现不好的公司，只要他们能够至少产生一定现金，而且我们对他们的管理层和劳务关系依然感到满意。我们希望自己不会重复那些会让我们买下表现不佳的公司的投资错误。我们对于那些认为表现欠佳的公司在大量的资本投入以后未来经营会改善的观点也相当谨慎。（有些预测听起来很合理，提出这一理论的人们也是发自内心的，但是，在最后，大部分在夕阳行业中的额外投资就像是在流沙中挣扎。）尽管如此，金拉米牌式的管理方式（每一轮抛弃一个表现最差的子公司）并不是我们的风格。我们宁愿牺牲一部分总体平均收益，也不愿进行这种行为。

11\. You should be fully aware of one attitude Charlie and I share that hurts our financial performance: Regardless of price, we have no interest at all in selling any good businesses that Berkshire owns. We are also very reluctant to sell sub-par businesses as long as we expect them to generate at least some cash and as long as we feel good about their managers and labor relations. We hope not to repeat the capital-allocation mistakes that led us into such sub-par businesses. And we react with great caution to suggestions that our poor businesses can be restored to satisfactory profitability by major capital expenditures. (The projections will be dazzling and the advocates sincere, but, in the end, major additional investment in a terrible industry usually is about as rewarding as struggling in quicksand.) Nevertheless, gin rummy managerial behavior (discard your least promising business at each turn) is not our style. We would rather have our overall results penalized a bit than engage in that kind of behavior.

<br>

我们将持续避免这种金拉米牌式的行为。确实，我们在80年代放弃了挣扎了20年的纺织公司，但只是因为我们认为它将会在未来继续永远处在亏损的情况。我们未曾考虑过出售那些能卖出好价格的子公司或者是抛弃我们那些进展欠佳的子公司，尽管我们会想办法处理那些会导致他们表现欠佳的问题。在这里，我们想澄清一些在2016年出现过的一些误解。我们在这里强调不出售原则是指我们控股的子公司，而不是我们持有的适销证券。

We continue to avoid gin rummy behavior. True, we closed our textile business in the mid-1980’s after 20 years of struggling with it, but only because we felt it was doomed to run never-ending operating losses. We have not, however, given thought to selling operations that would command very fancy prices nor have we dumped our laggards, though we focus hard on curing the problems that cause them to lag. To clean up some confusion voiced in 2016, we emphasize that the comments here refer to businesses we control, not to marketable securities.

<br>

12\. 我们会坦陈地向你通报业绩，强调我们所拥有的公司的优与劣。我们的指导方针是告诉你们那些如果换位思考我们会想要知道的信息。这些信息必不可缺。更何况，作为一个持有一家主流的新闻媒体公司的大公司，在通报业绩时使用比新闻工作者向他人报道时更低的精确度，标准，以及深度是不可饶恕的。我们同时相信诚实对于作为管理者的我们是有帮助的：误人者终误己

12\. We will be candid in our reporting to you, emphasizing the pluses and minuses important in appraising business value. Our guideline is to tell you the business facts that we would want to know if our positions were reversed. We owe you no less. Moreover, as a company with a major communications business, it would be inexcusable for us to apply lesser standards of accuracy, balance and incisiveness when reporting on ourselves than we would expect our news people to apply when reporting on others. We also believe candor benefits us as managers: The CEO who misleads others in public may eventually mislead himself in private.

<br>

在伯克希尔，你不会遇到巨额冲销的会计操纵手法，或者是重组，或者是任何季度或者年度报告的平滑处理。假如我们是在打高尔夫，我们将诚实说明我们用了多少杆才进洞，并从不会设法摆弄计分板。当我们不得不使用非常粗略的估计数据时，比如保险的准备金，我们会想尽力保证估计方法的一致和保守。

At Berkshire you will find no “big bath” accounting maneuvers or restructurings nor any “smoothing” of quarterly or annual results. We will always tell you how many strokes we have taken on each hole and never play around with the scorecard. When the numbers are a very rough “guesstimate,” as they necessarily must be in insurance reserving, we will try to be both consistent and conservative in our approach.

<br>

我们会以多种方式与你们沟通。通过年度报告，我会努力以合理的篇幅尽可能地详细提供所有公司的价值信息。我们同时也会尽量提供一些已经在网上公布过的简短但重要的季度报表的信息，虽然那些并不是我写的（演唱会一年举办一次足够了）。另一个重要的沟通渠道就是我们的年度股东大会，在那时候查理和我非常乐意用五个小时以上的时间回答关于伯克希尔的问题。但是有一个沟通方式我们办不到：一对一的方式。考虑到伯克希尔上千的股东数量，这种方式不可行。

We will be communicating with you in several ways. Through the annual report, I try to give all shareholders as much value-defining information as can be conveyed in a document kept to reasonable length. We also try to convey a liberal quantity of condensed but important information in the quarterly reports we post on the internet, though I don’t write those (one recital a year is enough). Still another important occasion for communication is our Annual Meeting, at which Charlie and I are delighted to spend five hours or more answering questions about Berkshire. But there is one way we can’t communicate: on a one-on-one basis. That isn’t feasible given Berkshire’s many thousands of owners.

<br>

在我们所有的沟通渠道中，我们想公平对待我们所有的股东：我们不想用行业普遍的做法，给分析师或者大股东收益数据或者重要信息的提示。我们的目标是让所有的股东同时获得信息。

In all of our communications, we try to make sure that no single shareholder gets an edge: We do not follow the usual practice of giving earnings “guidance” or other information of value to analysts or large shareholders. Our goal is to have all of our owners updated at the same time.

<br>

13\. 尽管我们的政策强调坦白，我们对于适销证券的信息披露只会停留在法律要求的程度。良好的投资机会，就像是良好的产品和商业收购机会一样，既稀有又珍贵，而且容易被捷足先登。所以我们一般不会公开谈论我们的投资想法。关于这项内容的保密也涵盖我们已经出售的证券（因为我们未来可能还会买）以及大家误以为我们会买的证券。如果我们对于这些谣言予以否决但是对于其他情况表示“无可奉告”，不评论也就变成了承认。

13\. Despite our policy of candor, we will discuss our activities in marketable securities only to the extent legally required. Good investment ideas are rare, valuable and subject to competitive appropriation just as good product or business acquisition ideas are. Therefore we normally will not talk about our investment ideas. This ban extends even to securities we have sold (because we may purchase them again) and to stocks we are incorrectly rumored to be buying. If we deny those reports but say “no comment” on other occasions, the no-comments become confirmation.

<br>

尽管我们会继续对个股的选择的公布有所保留，我们愿意公开谈论我们的商业和投资哲学。我从本杰明·格雷汉姆慷慨的知识分享中受益匪浅。他是金融史上最伟大的老师，所以我认为我应该将我从他身上学到知识继续传递给他人，尽管这么做会为伯克希尔产生新的潜在有利竞争者，就像本杰明曾经遇到的情况一样。

Though we continue to be unwilling to talk about specific stocks, we freely discuss our business and investment philosophy. I benefitted enormously from the intellectual generosity of Ben Graham, the greatest teacher in the history of finance, and I believe it appropriate to pass along what I learned from him, even if that creates new and able investment competitors for Berkshire just as Ben’s teachings did for him.

<br>

## 两个新加入的原则TWO ADDED PRINCIPLES

14\. 尽可能地，我们希望伯克希尔的股东在股票价值的损益变化是和股东所有权的内在价值的损益变化是一致的。为了能达到这一点，内在价值和市场价值的关系需要保持一致，而我们偏好的关系是1比1。这也就隐含了，我们宁愿看到伯克希尔的股价是处于公允价值而非高价。很明显，查理和我无法控制伯克希尔的股价。但是通过我们的政策和沟通，我们能够鼓励知情达理的股东们共同促成一个理性的价格。我们既不愿意高估和低估股价的方式可能会让某些股东失望。但是我们相信，这能够吸引想要从伯克希尔的商业发展中获利而不是从其他投资者的错误中获利的长期投资者。

14\. To the extent possible, we would like each Berkshire shareholder to record a gain or loss in market value during his period of ownership that is proportional to the gain or loss in per-share intrinsic value recorded by the company during that holding period. For this to come about, the relationship between the intrinsic value and the market price of a Berkshire share would need to remain constant, and by our preferences at 1-to-1. As that implies, we would rather see Berkshire’s stock price at a fair level than a high level. Obviously, Charlie and I can’t control Berkshire’s price. But by our policies and communications, we can encourage informed, rational behavior by owners that, in turn, will tend to produce a stock price that is also rational. Our it’s-as-bad-to-be-overvalued-as-to-be-undervalued approach may disappoint some shareholders. We believe, however, that it affords Berkshire the best prospect of attracting long-term investors who seek to profit from the progress of the company rather than from the investment mistakes of their partners.

<br>

15\. 我们周期性的将伯克希尔的每股账面价值变化和标普500的表现对比。长期来看，我们希望我们能跑赢这个基准。否则，投资者何必选择我们？但是这个衡量方法存在一定的短板，在下一部分会提到。更多的，现在年度的表现的对比没有以前那么有意义了。那是因为我们的持有的股份和标普500的关联越来越小了。同时，标普的收益计算是不考虑成本的，而伯克希尔的收益在考虑税收后只有65%。我们因此期望在市场表现低迷时跑赢标普，在市场表现优异时被标普击败。

15\. We regularly compare the gain in Berkshire’s per-share book value to the performance of the S&P 500. Over time, we hope to outpace this yardstick. Otherwise, why do our investors need us? The measurement, however, has certain shortcomings that are described in the next section. Moreover, it now is less meaningful on a year-to-year basis than was formerly the case. That is because our equity holdings, whose value tends to move with the S&P 500, are a far smaller portion of our net worth than they were in earlier years. Additionally, gains in the S&P stocks are counted in full in calculating that index, whereas gains in Berkshire’s equity holdings are counted at 65% because of the federal tax we incur. We, therefore, expect to outperform the S&P in lackluster years for the stock market and underperform when the market has a strong year.

<br>

## 内在价值INTRINSIC VALUE

现在让我们注意力放在之前提到的一个概念，这是你们将在未来的年度报告中持续将会看到的概念。

Now let’s focus on a term that I mentioned earlier and that you will encounter in future annual reports.

<br>

内在价值是一个各方面都非常重要的概念。它是唯一作为评估商业相对投资价值的逻辑方法。内在价值可以被简单定义为：从一个公司中能得到的未来现金流的折现后的价值。

Intrinsic value is an all-important concept that offers the only logical approach to evaluating the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses. Intrinsic value can be defined simply: It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life.

<br>

但是现金流的计算并不是那么简单。我们的定义暗示着，内在价值是一种估计而非准确计算，而且数据需要按利率变化和现金流预测的改变而不断调整。更何况，对于同样的事实，两个不同的人可能会有不同的结论，即便是查理和我都会有所不同。这也是我们不会给你们我们对于内在价值估计的原因之一。不过我们的年报会提供所有我们在计算内在价值时用到的信息。

The calculation of intrinsic value, though, is not so simple. As our definition suggests, intrinsic value is an estimate rather than a precise figure, and it is additionally an estimate that must be changed if interest rates move or forecasts of future cash flows are revised. Two people looking at the same set of facts, moreover – and this would apply even to Charlie and me – will almost inevitably come up with at least slightly different intrinsic value figures. That is one reason we never give you our estimates of intrinsic value. What our annual reports do supply, though, are the facts that we ourselves use to calculate this value.

<br>

同时，我们会周期性的公布我们的每股账面价值，一个更容易被计算的数据，虽然具体效果并不好。缺点并不存在于适销证券上，适销证券的账面价值直接等于市场价格。账面价值的缺点存在于我们的控股子公司的情况。在这些场合中，有时候账面价值和实际的内在价值的偏离的相当远。

Meanwhile, we regularly report our per-share book value, an easily calculable number, though one of limited use. The limitations do not arise from our holdings of marketable securities, which are carried on our books at their current prices. Rather the inadequacies of book value have to do with the companies we control, whose values as stated on our books may be far different from their intrinsic values.

<br>

这种偏离可以出现在两个方向上。比如在1964年我们可以说伯克希尔的每股账面价值是19.46美金。但是这个数据将大幅高估公司的内在价值，因为公司的所有资源都困在一个并不怎么赚钱的纺织公司里。我们的纺织业资产在持续经营的前提或者是在破产清算的前提下的计算出的内在价值都不等于他们的账面价值。然而，今天，伯克希尔的情况恰好相反，账面价值远远低估了内在价值。这是因为我们拥有的子公司的内在价值远高于他们的账面价值。

The disparity can go in either direction. For example, in 1964 we could state with certitude that Berkshire’s per-share book value was $19.46. However, that figure considerably overstated the company’s intrinsic value, since all of the company’s resources were tied up in a sub-profitable textile business. Our textile assets had neither going-concern nor liquidation values equal to their carrying values. Today, however, Berkshire’s situation is reversed: Now, our book value far understates Berkshire’s intrinsic value, a point true because many of the businesses we control are worth much more than their carrying value.

<br>

尽管他们呈现事实的能力有限，我们还是将伯克希尔的账面价值数据展现出来，因为他们依然可以作为粗略的，尽管大幅度低估的，内在价值衡量标尺。换一句话说，账面价值的每年变化率可以被认为合理接近于内在价值的变化率。

Inadequate though they are in telling the story, we give you Berkshire’s book-value figures because they today serve as a rough, albeit significantly understated, tracking measure for Berkshire’s intrinsic value. In other words, the percentage change in book value in any given year is likely to be reasonably close to that year’s change in intrinsic value.

<br>

如果你想要了解账面价值和内在价值的区别，大学教育可以作为一个投资的例子。大学的学费是账面价值。更准确的说法是，它应该还包括读大学期间不能工作而损失的工资。

You can gain some insight into the differences between book value and intrinsic value by looking at one form of investment, a college education. Think of the education’s cost as its “book value.” If this cost is to be accurate, it should include the earnings that were foregone by the student because he chose college rather than a job.

<br>

为了方便说明，我们在这里忽略大学带来的非经济性收益，而仅关注经济价值。首先我们需要评估大学毕业生一生将会获得的工资收入，然后减去如果没有读大学能得到的收入。这个超额的收入，在按照一定的利率经过折现到该学生的毕业日。计算出来的结果就是大学教育的内在经济价值。

For this exercise, we will ignore the important non-economic benefits of an education and focus strictly on its economic value. First, we must estimate the earnings that the graduate will receive over his lifetime and subtract from that figure an estimate of what he would have earned had he lacked his education. That gives us an excess earnings figure, which must then be discounted, at an appropriate interest rate, back to graduation day. The dollar result equals the intrinsic economic value of the education.

<br>

有些毕业生会发现大学教育的账面价值高于内在价值，也就意味着大学的学费花的不值得。在其他的情况下，教育的内在价值远高于账面价值，这个结果能证明资本被有效的利用了。无论如何，你可以明白账面价值和内在价值的关联并不大。

Some graduates will find that the book value of their education exceeds its intrinsic value, which means that whoever paid for the education didn’t get his money’s worth. In other cases, the intrinsic value of an education will far exceed its book value, a result that proves capital was wisely deployed. In all cases, what is clear is that book value is meaningless as an indicator of intrinsic value.

<br>

## 伯克希尔的管理THE MANAGING OF BERKSHIRE

我认为我应该在最后谈一下伯克希尔当前以及未来的管理层结构。就像我们的第一条股东原则说的那样，查理和我是伯克希尔的一般合伙人。但是我们将复杂的管理职责放权给了我们子公司的经理。实际上我们几乎相当于完全弃权了：虽然伯克希尔有36.7万员工，总部只有25位。

I think it’s appropriate that I conclude with a discussion of Berkshire’s management, today and in the future. As our first owner-related principle tells you, Charlie and I are the managing partners of Berkshire. But we subcontract all of the heavy lifting in this business to the managers of our subsidiaries. In fact, we delegate almost to the point of abdication: Though Berkshire has about 367,000 employees, only 25 of these are at headquarters.

<br>

查理和我主要关注资本的分配以及经理的管理和生计问题。他们之中的大多数都是偏好自己全权打理公司，这也是我们对于经理的默认管理方法。这将使得他们全权管理公司的经营策略和以及保留收益的额度。当他们将现金交给我们后，他们将不会因为需要管理额外的资金而被诱惑。更多的，查理和我，相对于我们的经理在他们自己的行业内，有更多的投资机会。

Charlie and I mainly attend to capital allocation and the care and feeding of our key managers. Most of these managers are happiest when they are left alone to run their businesses, and that is customarily just how we leave them. That puts them in charge of all operating decisions and of dispatching the excess cash they generate to headquarters. By sending it to us, they don’t get diverted by the various enticements that would come their way were they responsible for deploying the cash their businesses throw off. Furthermore, Charlie and I are exposed to a much wider range of possibilities for investing these funds than any of our managers could find in his or her own industry.

<br>

我们的经理的大部分已经达到了财富自由，这也就需要让我们培养一种能让他们为伯克希尔工作而不是去打高尔夫或者钓鱼的企业文化。这意味着我们需要公平对待他们，设身处地为他们着想。

Most of our managers are independently wealthy, and it’s therefore up to us to create a climate that encourages them to choose working with Berkshire over golfing or fishing. This leaves us needing to treat them fairly and in the manner that we would wish to be treated if our positions were reversed.

<br>

而在资产分配这件事上，这是一个查理和我都乐意做而且已经积累了一定经验的事情。一般来说，年龄并不会影响我们的发挥：你不需要非常好的动作协调性，或者是发达的肌肉来管理资本（感谢上天）。只要我们的大脑能够有效的运转，查理和我可以像我们在以前那样继续工作下去。

As for the allocation of capital, that’s an activity both Charlie and I enjoy and in which we have acquired some useful experience. In a general sense, grey hair doesn’t hurt on this playing field: You don’t need good hand-eye coordination or well-toned muscles to push money around (thank heavens). As long as our minds continue to function effectively, Charlie and I can keep on doing our jobs pretty much as we have in the past.

<br>

在我死后，伯克希尔的股东结构将会改变，但是不会产生破坏性影响：我的股份都不会用于遗产的分配或者纳税。我的其他财产足以应付遗产要求。所有的伯克希尔股份将会按每年相同数量分配给多个基金会。

On my death, Berkshire’s ownership picture will change but not in a disruptive way: None of my stock will have to be sold to take care of the cash bequests I have made or for taxes. Other assets of mine will take care of these requirements. All Berkshire shares will be left to foundations that will likely receive the stock in roughly equal installments over a dozen or so years.

<br>

在我的死后，巴菲特家族不会参与公司的管理，但是作为大股东，将会参与选拔和监督公司的经理。那些经理将会是谁将取决我什么时候离开。但是我可预测管理层的结构将是：基本上我的职责将会被分为两个部分。一个总经理将会成为CEO并且管理日常经营。投资的职责将会交给一个或者多个总经理。如果有新的收购项目，这些总经理在必要时刻，在董事会的许可下，共同作出决策。我们将继续维持以股东为导向的董事会，他们的利益会和你们保持一致。

At my death, the Buffett family will not be involved in managing the business but, as very substantial shareholders, will help in picking and overseeing the managers who do. Just who those managers will be, of course, depends on the date of my death. But I can anticipate what the management structure will be: Essentially my job will be split into two parts. One executive will become CEO and responsible for operations. The responsibility for investments will be given to one or more executives. If the acquisition of new businesses is in prospect, these executives will cooperate in making the decisions needed, subject, of course, to board approval. We will continue to have an extraordinarily shareholder-minded board, one whose interests are solidly aligned with yours.

<br>

如果处于某些原因，我们需要立刻执行我刚刚提到的管理层结构，董事会知道我在两个部分的候选人是哪些。所有的候选人要么已经在伯克希尔工作，要么随时可以为伯克希尔办公。他们都是我完全信任的人。我们的管理者名单处于史无前例的最佳状态。

Were we to need the management structure I have just described on an immediate basis, our directors know my recommendations for both posts. All candidates currently work for or are available to Berkshire and are people in whom I have total confidence. Our managerial roster has never been stronger.

<br>

我会持续向董事会报告候选人情况。因为伯克希尔是我的全部财产，而且将会成为日后长时间作为多个基金会的资产，所以你可以放心相信董事会和我认真考虑过并且准备好了候选人的问题。同样你可以相信我们一直以来应用的股东原则将会在领导着我的继承人，我们有效而鲜明的企业文化也将继续维持。作为额外的保障，我相信在我不再是CEO时将巴菲特家族的一名成员作为不收工资的非执行董事成员会是一个好办法。具体是否会采纳将取决于那时董事会的决定。

I will continue to keep the directors posted on the succession issue. Since Berkshire stock will make up virtually my entire estate and will account for a similar portion of the assets of various foundations for a considerable period after my death, you can be sure that the directors and I have thought through the succession question carefully and that we are well prepared. You can be equally sure that the principles we have employed to date in running Berkshire will continue to guide the managers who succeed me and that our unusually strong and well-defined culture will remain intact. As an added assurance that this will be the case, I believe it would be wise when I am no longer CEO to have a member of the Buffett family serve as the non-paid, non-executive Chairman of the Board. That decision, however, will be the responsibility of the then Board of Directors.

<br>

尽管我们谈了这么多不愉快的事情，我还是想告诉你们我从未像现在这样感到开心。我热爱管理伯克希尔。如果热爱生活的人会长寿，那么玛士撒拉的长寿记录可能将会被我打破。

Lest we end on a morbid note, I also want to assure you that I have never felt better. I love running Berkshire, and if enjoying life promotes longevity, Methuselah’s record is in jeopardy.

<br>

巴菲特穿着他最喜欢的内布拉斯加红色毛衣，外套一件格子衬衫，和克拉克一起站在讲台上。讲完他的全部故事。[^1]

Buffett joined Clarke at the podium, wearing his favorite Nebraska red sweater over a plaid shirt. He finished the story.

[^1]: 为了可读性和长度，巴菲特的言论被精简了。Buffett’s remarks have been condensed for readability and length.

<br>

“科夫（Keough）一家是很棒的邻居，”他说。“确实有时候唐（Don）会提到，他和我不一样，他有一份工作，但我们的关系很好。有一次，我的妻子苏西（Susie）过去借了一杯糖，就像中西部人常做的那样，而唐的妻子米基（Mickie）给了她一整袋。当我听说这件事时，我决定那天晚上也去科夫家。我对唐说，‘你为什么不给我两万五千美元，让我为合伙人投资呢？’科夫一家在那时有点紧张，我被拒绝了。”

“The Keoughs were wonderful neighbors,” he said. “It’s true that occasionally Don would mention that, unlike me, he had a job, but the relationship was terrific. One time my wife, Susie, went over and did the proverbial Midwestern bit of asking to borrow a cup of sugar, and Don’s wife, Mickie, gave her a whole sack. When I heard about that, I decided to go over to the Keoughs’ that night myself. I said to Don, ‘Why don’t you give me twenty-five thousand dollars for the partnership to invest?’ And the Keough family stiffened a little bit at that point, and I was rejected.

<br>

“我后来又回来，要求克拉克提到的一万美元，结果也是一样。但我并不自豪。所以我又过了一段时间，要求五千美元。到了那时，我又被拒绝了。”

“I came back sometime later and asked for the ten thousand dollars Clarke referred to and got a similar result. But I wasn’t proud. So I returned at a later time and asked for five thousand dollars. And at that point, I got rejected again.

<br>

“所以有一天晚上，1962年夏天，我开始朝着基奥家走去。我不知道我会不会把价格降到两千五百美元，但是当我到了基奥家的时候，整个地方都是黑暗的，寂静无声。看不到任何东西。但我知道发生了什么。我知道唐和米基正在楼上躲着，所以我没有离开。”

“So one night, in the summer of 1962, I started heading over to the Keough house. I don’t know whether I would have dropped it to twenty-five hundred dollars or not, but by the time I got to the Keough household, the whole place was dark, silent. There wasn’t a thing to see. But I knew what was going on. I knew that Don and Mickie were hiding upstairs, so I didn’t leave.

<br>

“我按了门铃。我敲了敲门。没人应。但是唐和米基在楼上，而且一片漆黑。”

“I rang that doorbell. I knocked. Nothing happened. But Don and Mickie were upstairs, and it was pitch-black.

<br>

“太黑了，看不清楚。太早了，没到睡觉的时候。我记得那一天就像昨天一样清楚。那是1962年6月21日。”

“Too dark to read, and too early to go to sleep. And I remember that day as if it were yesterday. That was June twenty-first, 1962.

<br>

“克拉克，你什么时候出生的？”

“Clarke, when were you born?”

<br>

“1963年3月21日。”

“March twenty-first, 1963.”

<br>

“就是这样的小事，历史才会因此改变。所以你应该庆幸他们没有给我一万美元。”

“It’s little things like that that history turns on. So you should be glad they didn’t give me the ten thousand dollars.”

<br>

在用这个小小的互动吸引了观众的注意后，巴菲特转向了手头的事情。“现在，我要尝试一下多任务处理。赫伯（Herb）让我加入了几张幻灯片。‘要跟上时代，’他说。在巴菲特家里，赫伯说的话就像是一条命令。”他故意忽略了“巴菲特家庭”到底包括了什么——因为巴菲特认为他的家庭就像其他普通家庭一样——他开始讲了一个关于艾伦（Allen）的笑话。美国总统的秘书匆匆跑进椭圆形办公室，为不小心安排了两个同时进行的会议而道歉。总统必须在见教皇和见赫伯特·艾伦之间做出选择。巴菲特停顿了一下，制造效果。“‘让教皇进来，’总统说。‘至少我只需要亲他的戒指。’”

Having charmed the audience with this little piece of give and take, Buffett turned to the matter at hand. “Now, I’m going to attempt to multitask today. Herb told me to include a few slides. ‘Show you’re with it,’ he said. When Herb says something, it’s practically an order in the Buffett household.” Speeding past exactly what comprised “the Buffett household”—for Buffett thought of his household as being like any other family’s—he launched into a joke about Allen. The secretary to the President of the U.S. rushed into the Oval Office, apologizing for accidentally scheduling two meetings at once. The President had to choose between seeing the Pope and seeing Herbert Allen. Buffett paused for effect. “ ‘Send in the Pope,’ said the President. ‘At least I only have to kiss his ring.’

<br>

“各位亲爱的戒指亲吻者，今天我想跟你们谈谈股市，”他说。“我将讨论如何定价股票，但我不会讨论预测它们下个月或明年的走势。估值和预测不是一回事。”

“To all you fellow ring-kissers, I would like to talk today about the stock market,” he said. “I will be talking about pricing stocks, but I will not be talking about predicting their course of action next month or next year. Valuing is not the same as predicting.

<br>

“短期来看，市场就像是投票机。而从长期角度，它则是称重机。

“In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it’s a weighing machine.

<br>

“重量最终是有影响的。但在短期内，投票的影响力较大。而这种投票方式并不十分民主。遗憾的是，他们并没有设立任何投票资格能力测试，就如你们所了解的那样。”

“Weight counts eventually. But votes count in the short term. And it’s a very undemocratic way of voting. Unfortunately, they have no literacy tests in terms of voting qualifications, as you’ve all learned.”

<br>

巴菲特按下了一个按钮，他右侧的巨大屏幕上亮起了一个 PowerPoint 幻灯片。[^2]坐在观众席上的比尔·盖茨屏住了呼吸，直到以笨手笨脚而著名的巴菲特成功展示出第一张幻灯片。[^3]

Buffett clicked a button, which illuminated a PowerPoint slide on a huge screen to his right.17 Bill Gates, sitting in the audience, caught his breath until the notoriously fumble-fingered Buffett managed to get the first slide up.

<br>

他走向屏幕开始解释。

He walked over to the screen and started explaining.

<br>

“在这十七年里，经济规模增长了五倍。《财富》五百强公司的销售额增长了五倍以上。[^4]然而，在这十七年中，股市几乎毫无变化。”

“During these seventeen years, the size of the economy grew fivefold. The sales of the Fortune five hundred companies grew more than fivefold.* Yet, during these seventeen years, the stock market went exactly nowhere.”

[^4]: 广泛引用的美国股票指标。A widely quoted U.S. stock measure.

<br>

他后退了一两步。“当你投资时，你正在做的是延迟消费，现在花钱以便在未来的某个时候获取更多的回报。这里真正只有两个问题。一个是你能拿回多少，另一个是何时拿回。

He backed up a step or two. “What you’re doing when you invest is deferring consumption and laying money out now to get more money back at a later time. And there are really only two questions. One is how much you’re going to get back, and the other is when.

<br>

“伊索并不擅长金融，因为他说过类似这样的话，‘手中一鸟胜过林中两鸟。’ 但他没有说什么时候。”利率——借款的成本——巴菲特解释说，是“何时”的价格。它们对金融就像引力对物理学一样。随着利率的变化，所有金融资产——房屋、股票、债券的价值都会改变，就好像鸟的价格发生了波动。“这就是为什么有时手中的一只鸟比林中的两只鸟更好，有时林中的两只鸟比手中的一只鸟更好。”

“Now, Aesop was not much of a finance major, because he said something like, ‘A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.’ But he doesn’t say when.” Interest rates—the cost of borrowing—Buffett explained, are the price of “when.” They are to finance as gravity is to physics. As interest rates vary, the value of all financial assets—houses, stocks, bonds—changes, as if the price of birds had fluctuated. “And that’s why sometimes a bird in the hand is better than two birds in the bush and sometimes two in the bush are better than one in the hand.”

<br>

他以平淡、气息急促的口吻说话，言辞之快，有时连他自己都跟不上。巴菲特将伊索的寓言与1990年代的大牛市联系起来，他形容这是一场空洞的牛市。利润增长远不及之前的那个时期，但由于利率低，林中的鸟价格昂贵。很少有人愿意在如此低的利率下持有现金——手中的鸟。所以，投资者们为了那些林中的鸟付出了前所未有的价格。巴菲特轻描淡写地将此称为“贪婪因素”。

In his flat, breathy twang, the words coming so fast that they sometimes ran over one another, Buffett related Aesop to the great bull market of the 1990s, which he described as baloney. Profits had grown much less than in that previous period, but birds in the bush were expensive because interest rates were low. Fewer people wanted cash—the bird in the hand—at such low rates. So investors were paying unheard-of prices for those birds in the bush. Casually, Buffett referred to this as the “greed factor.”

<br>

全场观众，都是在大牛市中变得富有的科技大佬们，他们在改变世界。他们静静地坐着，他们的投资组合中塞满了估值超高的股票。他们对此感到十分满意。这是一个新的模式，互联网时代的曙光。他们认为巴菲特没有权利称他们贪婪。沃伦——他积蓄了多年，很少有慷慨之举，他如此节俭，以至于他的车牌上写着“节约”，他大部分时间都在考虑如何赚钱，他错过了科技繁荣和机会——他在他们的香槟里吐口水。

The audience, full of technology gurus who were changing the world while getting rich off the great bull market, sat silent. They were perched atop portfolios that were jam-packed with stocks trading at extravagant valuations. They felt terrific about that. It was a new paradigm, this dawning of the Internet age. Their attitude was that Buffett had no right to call them greedy. Warren—who’d hoarded his money for years and given very little away, who was so cheap his license plate said “Thrifty,” who spent most of his time thinking about how to make money, who had blown the technology boom and missed the boat—was spitting in their champagne.

<br>

巴菲特继续说道。股市能以每年十分之一或更多的速度持续上升，只有三种可能。一种是如果利率下降并保持在历史水平以下。第二种是如果分给投资者的经济份额，相对于给雇员和政府以及其他事物的份额，上升到已经历史性高位的水平。[^5] 或者，他说，经济可能开始增长得比正常水平更快。[^6]他称使用这些乐观的假设是“一厢情愿”的想法。

Buffett continued. There were only three ways the stock market could keep rising at ten percent or more a year. One was if interest rates fell and remained below historic levels. The second was if the share of the economy that went to investors, as opposed to employees and government and other things, rose above its already historically high level.19 Or, he said, the economy could start growing faster than normal.20 He called it “wishful thinking” to use optimistic assumptions like these.

[^5]: 当时的企业利润超过 GDP 的 6%，而长期平均水平为 4.88%。 他们后来升至 9% 以上，远高于历史标准。Corporate profits at the time were more than 6% of GDP, compared to a long-term average of 4.88%. They later rose to over 9%, far above historic standards.

[^6]: 长期以来，美国经济的实际增长率为 3%，名义增长率（扣除通货膨胀后）为 5%。 除了战后繁荣或从严重衰退中复苏之外，很少有人超过这一水平。Over long periods the U.S. economy has grown at a real rate of 3% and a nominal rate (after inflation) of 5%. Other than a postwar boom or recovery from severe recession, this level is rarely exceeded.

<br>

他说，有些人并不认为整个市场都会繁荣。他们只是相信自己能从其他人中挑选出赢家。他挥舞着手臂，就像一个管弦乐团的指挥，一边解释虽然创新可能会使世界摆脱贫困，但历史上投资创新的人们事后并未感到高兴，一边成功地放上了另一张幻灯片。

Some people, he said, were not thinking that the whole market would flourish. They just believed they could pick the winners from the rest. Swinging his arms like an orchestra conductor, he succeeded in putting up another slide while explaining that, although innovation might lift the world out of poverty, people who invest in innovation historically have not been glad afterward.

<br>

“这是来自一个70页清单的半页内容，列出了美国所有的汽车公司。”他在空中挥舞着完整的清单。“曾有两千家汽车公司：可能是二十世纪上半叶最重要的发明。它对人们的生活产生了巨大影响。如果你在第一辆汽车出现的时候看到了这个国家如何与汽车共同发展，你就会说，‘这就是我必须在的地方。’但在这两千家公司中，直到几年前，只有三家汽车公司幸存[^7]。而且，这三家公司中的每一家在某个时候都曾以低于账面价值的价格出售，账面价值就是投入公司并留在那里的金额。所以，汽车对美国产生了巨大影响，但对投资者则产生了相反的影响。”

“This is half of a page which comes from a list seventy pages long of all the auto companies in the United States.” He waved the complete list in the air. “There were two thousand auto companies: the most important invention, probably, of the first half of the twentieth century. It had an enormous impact on people’s lives. If you had seen at the time of the first cars how this country would develop in connection with autos, you would have said, ‘This is the place I must be.’ But of the two thousand companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived. And, at one time or another, all three were selling for less than book value, which is the amount of money that had been put into the companies and left there. So autos had an enormous impact on America, but in the opposite direction on investors.”

[^7]: 美国汽车公司，最小的“四大”汽车制造商之一，于1987年被克莱斯勒收购American Motors, smallest of the “Big Four” automakers, sold out to Chrysler in 1987.

<br>

他放下清单，把手塞进口袋。“现在，有时候找出输家要容易得多。我认为，当时有一个明显的决定。当然，你应该做的事情是做空马。”[^8] 点击。一个关于马的幻灯片弹了出来。

He put down the list to shove his hand in his pocket. “Now, sometimes it’s much easier to figure out the losers. There was, I think, one obvious decision back then. And, of course, the thing you should have been doing was shorting horses.”* Click. A slide about horses popped up.

[^8]: 《财富》杂志根据销售额对最大的 500 家公司进行排名，并将它们称为“财富 500 强”。 这组公司可以用作美国企业的粗略代表。Fortune magazine ranks the largest 500 companies based on sales and refers to them as the “Fortune 500.” This group of companies can be used as a rough proxy for U.S.-based business.

<br>

美国马的数量

U.S. HORSE POPULATION

1900— 1700万 17 million

1998— 500万 5 million

<br>

“坦率地说，我有点失望，巴菲特家族在这整个时期都没有做空马。总是有输家的。”

“Frankly, I’m kind of disappointed that the Buffett family was not shorting horses throughout this entire period. There are always losers.”

<br>

观众们轻轻笑了，尽管声音微弱。他们的公司可能正在亏损，但他们心中坚信他们是赢家，他们是在天际发生巨大变化的时刻闪耀的超新星。

Members of the audience chuckled, albeit faintly. Their companies might be losing money, but in their hearts beat a conviction that they were winners, supernovas blazing at the cusp of a momentous shift in the heavens.

<br>

点击。另一张幻灯片出现了。

Click. Another slide appeared.

<br>

“二十世纪上半叶的另一项伟大发明是飞机。在1919年到1939年这段期间，大约有两百家公司。想象一下，如果你当时能看到在基蒂霍克的航空工业的未来。你会看到一个你从未梦想过的世界。但假设你有这种洞察力，你看到所有这些人都希望飞翔，去拜访他们的亲戚，或者从他们的亲戚那里逃跑，或者做任何你在飞机上要做的事情，你决定这就是你要去的地方。

“Now, the other great invention of the first half of the century was the airplane. In this period from 1919 to 1939, there were about two hundred companies. Imagine if you could have seen the future of the airline industry back there at Kitty Hawk. You would have seen a world undreamed of. But assume you had the insight, and you saw all of these people wishing to fly and to visit their relatives or run away from their relatives or whatever you do in an airplane, and you decided this was the place to be.

<br>

“直到几年前，从历史上看，航空工业的所有股票投资累计起来一共没有赚到任何钱。

“As of a couple of years ago, there had been zero money made from the aggregate of all stock investments in the airline industry in history.

<br>

“所以我向你们提出：我真的很喜欢想象，如果我当时在基蒂霍克，我应该足够有远见，足够有公心，去击落奥维尔。我欠未来的资本家这个。”[^9]

“So I submit to you: I really like to think that if I had been down there at Kitty Hawk, I would have been farsighted enough and public-spirited enough to have shot Orville down. I owed it to future capitalists.”

[^9]: 这里，巴菲特是在比喻说话。他承认自己一两次投资了带翅膀的东西，但结果并不好。Buffett is speaking metaphorically here. He admits to investing in things with wings a time or two, and not with good results.

<br>

人们再次轻轻地笑了一下。有些人开始厌倦这些陈旧的例子。但出于尊重，他们让巴菲特继续。

Another light chuckle. Some were getting tired of these musty old examples. But out of respect, they let Buffett get on with it.

<br>

现在他开始谈论他们的业务。“推广新行业是很棒的，因为它们非常容易被推广。推广一个平淡无奇的产品是非常困难的。推广一个深奥的产品，尤其是一个有损失的产品，要容易得多，因为没有定量的指导。”这直接攻击了观众，让他们痛苦。“但人们会不断回来投资，你知道。这让我想起了一个故事，关于一个油田勘探者死后去了天堂。圣彼得说，‘嗯，我查过你，你符合所有的条件。但有一个问题。’他说，‘我们在这里有一些严格的分区法，我们把所有的油田勘探者都关在那个围栏里。你可以看到，那里已经满得快要爆炸了。没有你的位置。’

Now he was talking about their businesses. “It’s wonderful to promote new industries, because they are very promotable. It’s very hard to promote investment in a mundane product. It’s much easier to promote an esoteric product, even particularly one with losses, because there’s no quantitative guideline.” This was goring the audience directly, where it hurt. “But people will keep coming back to invest, you know. It reminds me a little of that story of the oil prospector who died and went to heaven. And St. Peter said, ‘Well, I checked you out, and you meet all of the qualifications. But there’s one problem.’ He said, ‘We have some tough zoning laws up here, and we keep all of the oil prospectors over in that pen. And as you can see, it is absolutely chock-full. There is no room for you.’

<br>

“那个勘探者说，‘你介意我只说四个字吗？’

“And the prospector said, ‘Do you mind if I just say four words?’

<br>

“圣彼得说，‘那没什么问题。’

“St. Peter said, ‘No harm in that.’

<br>

“所以那个勘探者捧起手，大声喊道，‘地狱有油！’

“So the prospector cupped his hands and yells out, ‘Oil discovered in hell!’

<br>

“然后，笼子的锁就开了，所有的油田勘探者都开始直奔地狱。

“And of course, the lock comes off the cage and all of the oil prospectors start heading right straight down.

<br>

“圣彼得说，‘那是一个非常聪明的把戏。那么，’他说，‘进去吧，像在自己家一样。这里有你想要的所有空间。’

“St. Peter said, ‘That’s a pretty slick trick. So,’ he says, ‘go on in, make yourself at home. All the room in the world.’

<br>

“那个勘探者停了一会儿，然后说，‘不，我想我还是和其他人一起去吧。那个谣言说不定是真的。’[^10]

“The prospector paused for a minute, then said, ‘No, I think I’ll go along with the rest of the boys. There might be some truth to that rumor after all.’

[^10]: 巴菲特在 1985 年董事长的信中首次使用了这个故事，引用了本·格雷厄姆 (Ben Graham) 的话，格雷厄姆在纽约金融学院证券分析当前问题系列的第十次演讲中讲述了这个故事。 这些讲座的文字记录于 1946 年 9 月至 1947 年 2 月之间提供，可在 http://www.wiley.com//legacy/products/subject/finance/bgraham/ 或本杰明·格雷厄姆和珍妮特·洛，*重新发现的本杰明格雷厄姆：华尔街传奇文选*。 纽约：威利出版社，1999 年。Buffett first used this story in his 1985 chairman’s letter, citing Ben Graham, who told the story at his tenth lecture in the series Current Problems in Security Analysis at the New York Institute of Finance. The transcripts of these lectures, given between September 1946 and February 1947, can be found at http://www.wiley.com//legacy/products/subject/finance/bgraham/ or in Benjamin Graham and Janet Lowe, The Rediscovered Benjamin Graham: Selected Writings of the Wall Street Legend. New York: Wiley, 1999.

<br>

“嗯，人们对股票就是这种感觉。很容易相信那个谣言说不定是真的。”

“Well, that’s the way people feel with stocks. It’s very easy to believe that there’s some truth to that rumor after all.”

<br>

这引起了半秒钟的微笑，但是，一旦观众明白了巴菲特的观点，笑声就停了。他的观点是，他们可能会像那些勘探者一样，不假思索地跟随谣言，到地狱去钻石油。

This got a mild laugh for a half second, which choked off as soon as the audience caught on to Buffett’s point, which was that, like the prospectors, they might be mindless enough to follow rumors and drill for oil in hell.

<br>

他通过回到那句谚语中的灌木丛中的鸟来结束。他说，股市没有改变。最终，股市的价值只能反映经济的产出。

He closed by returning to the proverbial bird in the bush. There was no new paradigm, he said. Ultimately, the value of the stock market could only reflect the output of the economy.

<br>

他放上一张幻灯片，以说明在过去的几年里，市场的估值已经大大超过了经济的增长。巴菲特说，这意味着接下来的十七年可能不会比1964年到1981年那个长时间段看起来好多少，当时道琼斯指数一直没有变化——也就是说，除非市场暴跌。“如果我必须选一个在那个期间最有可能的回报，”他说，“那可能是6%。”[^11]然而，最近的一次PaineWebber-Gallup民意调查显示，投资者预计股票将回报13%到22%。[^12]

He put up a slide to illustrate how, for several years, the market’s valuation had outstripped the economy’s growth by an enormous degree. This meant, Buffett said, that the next seventeen years might not look much better than that long stretch from 1964 to 1981 when the Dow had gone exactly nowhere—that is, unless the market plummeted. “If I had to pick the most probable return over that period,” he said, “it would probably be six percent.” Yet a recent PaineWebber-Gallup poll had shown that investors expected stocks to return thirteen to twenty-two percent.

<br>

他走到屏幕前。他扬起浓密的眉毛，指着一个裸体男人和女人的漫画，这个漫画取自一本关于股市的传奇书籍，叫《顾客的游艇在哪里？》[^13]“男人对女人说，‘有些事情是不能通过言语或图片充分解释给处女的。’ ”观众明白了他的观点，即那些买互联网股票的人即将遭受重创。他们默默无言地坐着。没有人笑。没有人笑出声，没有人嘲笑或大笑。

He walked over to the screen. Waggling his bushy eyebrows, he gestured at the cartoon of a naked man and woman, taken from a legendary book on the stock market, Where Are the Customers’ Yachts? “The man said to the woman, ‘There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words or pictures.’ ” The audience took his point, which was that people who bought Internet stocks were about to get screwed. They sat in stony silence. Nobody laughed. Nobody chuckled or snickered or guffawed.

<br>

巴菲特似乎没有注意到这一点，他走回讲台，向观众讲述了他从伯克希尔哈撒韦带来的礼品袋。“我刚买了一家出售分时使用喷气机的公司，NetJets，”他说。“我想给你们每人一个Gulfstream IV的四分之一份额。但是当我去机场时，我意识到对你们大多数人来说，这将是一种降级。”听到这个，他们笑了。所以，他继续说，他给每个人都送了一把珠宝放大镜，他说他们应该用它来看看彼此妻子的戒指——特别是第三任妻子的。

Seeming not to notice, Buffett moved back to the podium and told the audience about the goody bag he had brought for them from Berkshire Hathaway. “I just bought a company that sells fractional jets, NetJets,” he said. “I thought about giving each of you a quarter share of a Gulfstream IV. But when I went to the airport, I realized that’d be a step down for most of you.” At that, they laughed. So, he continued, he was giving each of them a jeweler’s loupe instead, which he said they should use to look at one another’s wives’ rings—the third wives’ especially.

<br>

这一点准确无误。观众笑了起来，鼓起掌来。然后他们停下来了。一股怨恨的暗流在房间里涌动。在1999年的Sun Valley对股市的过度行为进行说教，就像在妓院里宣扬贞节。这篇演讲可能会吸引观众注意，但这并不意味着他们会去戒除。

That hit its mark. The audience laughed and applauded. Then they stopped. A resentful undercurrent was washing through the room. Sermonizing on the stock market’s excesses at Sun Valley in 1999 was like preaching chastity in a house of ill repute. The speech might rivet the audience to its chairs, but that didn’t mean that they would go forth and abstain.

<br>

然而，有些人认为他们正在听到一些重要的事情。“这太棒了，这就是关于股市的基本教程，一次性上完所有的课程，”盖茨想。[^14]许多正在寻找更便宜股票的资金经理人觉得这很安慰，甚至觉得它是一种宣泄。

Yet some thought they were hearing something important. “This is great; it’s the basic tutorial on the stock market, all in one lesson,” thought Gates. The money managers, many of whom were hunting for cheaper stocks, found it comforting and even cathartic.

[^14]: 与比尔·盖茨的访谈。Interview with Bill Gates.

<br>

巴菲特在空中挥舞着一本书。“这本书是1929年股市狂热的知识基础。埃德加·劳伦斯·史密斯的《作为长期投资的普通股》证明了股票总是比债券产生更多的收益。史密斯找出了五个原因，但其中最新颖的一个是公司保留了部分收益，他们可以以相同的回报率进行再投资。这就是反耕作——在1924年这是一个新颖的观点！但是像我的导师本·格雷厄姆总是说的那样，‘你可能因为一个好主意而惹上更多的麻烦，而不是一个坏主意，’因为你忘记了好主意是有限的。凯恩斯勋爵在他给这本书的序言中说，‘存在一种危险，期望未来的结果可以从过去预测。’”[^15]

Buffett waved a book in the air. “This book was the intellectual underpinning of the 1929 stock-market mania. Edgar Lawrence Smith’s Common Stocks as Long Term Investments proved that stocks always yielded more than bonds. Smith identified five reasons, but the most novel of these was the fact that companies retained some of their earnings, which they could reinvest at the same rate of return. That was the plowback—a novel idea in 1924! But as my mentor, Ben Graham, always used to say, ‘You can get in way more trouble with a good idea than a bad idea,’ because you forget that the good idea has limits. Lord Keynes, in his preface to this book, said, ‘There is a danger of expecting the results of the future to be predicted from the past.’ ”

[^15]: 凯恩斯写道：“对未来应用基于过去经验的归纳论断是危险的……除非我们可以区分出为什么过去的经验是这样的广泛原因”，他在1925年为史密斯的《作为长期投资的普通股》的《国家和雅典艳》的书评中写道，后来成为凯恩斯，《约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯著作集》卷12，经济文章和通信；投资和编辑。剑桥：剑桥大学出版社，1983年。Keynes wrote: “It is dangerous … to apply to the future inductive arguments based on past experience, unless one can distinguish the broad reasons why past experience was what it was,” in a book review for Smith’s Common Stocks as Long-Term Investments in Nation and Athenaeum in 1925 that later became the preface for Keynes, The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes. Vol.12, Economic Articles and Correspondence; Investment and Editorial. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983.

<br>

他又回到了同样的主题：人们不能从过去几年股价的加速上升中推断出未来。“现在，有没有我没冒犯的人？”[^16]他停顿了一下。这个问题是反问的；没有人举手。

He had worked his way back around to the same subject: that one couldn’t extrapolate from the past few years of accelerating stock prices. “Now, is there anyone I haven’t insulted?” He paused. The question was rhetorical; nobody raised a hand.

[^16]: 喜剧演员莫特·萨尔常常以“有没有我没冒犯的人”结束他的表演。The comedian Mort Sahl used to end his routine by asking, “Is there anyone I haven’t offended?”

<br>

“谢谢你们，”他说，然后结束了。

“Thank you,” he said, and ended.

<br>

“名誉赞美，类别批评”是巴菲特的原则。这场演讲意在挑战，而不是令人反感——因为他非常在乎他们对他的看法。他没有指名道姓地指责任何人，并且他认为他们会对他的笑话有所回应。他的论点非常有力，几乎无法反驳，他认为即使那些不喜欢他的信息的人也必须承认它的力量。无论观众感到的不安如何，都没有公开表示出来。他回答了问题，直到会议结束。人们开始站起来，向他表示赞扬。无论他们如何看待这场演讲——关于如何思考投资的精彩论述，还是一头老狮子的最后咆哮——这场演讲无论如何都是一场精彩的表演。

“Praise by name, criticize by category” was Buffett’s rule. The speech was meant to be provocative, not off-putting—for he cared a great deal what they thought of him. He had named no culprits, and he assumed they would get over his jokes. His argument was so powerful, almost unassailable, that he thought even those who didn’t like its message must acknowledge its force. And whatever unease the audience felt was not expressed aloud. He answered questions until the session ended. People began to stand, awarding him an ovation. No matter how they saw it—a masterful exposition on how to think about investing or the last roar of an old lion—the speech was by any standard a tour de force.

<br>

*《财富》杂志 - 伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司的董事长沃伦·巴菲特几乎从不公开谈论股价的总体水平——无论是在他著名的年度报告中，还是在伯克希尔人山人海的年度会议上，亦或是他偶尔的演讲中。然而，在过去的几个月里，巴菲特在四个场合针对这个主题发表了观点，以分析和创新的方式阐述了他对股票长期前景的看法。《财富》杂志的卡罗尔·洛米斯听到了他在九月份对一群巴菲特的朋友们（她也是其中之一）的最后一次演讲，也观看了他在七月份在爱伦·公司在爱达荷州太阳谷为商业领袖们举办的派对上的第一次演讲的录像。洛米斯从这些即兴演讲中（第一次演讲时道琼斯工业平均指数为11194）提炼出了巴菲特说过的内容，巴菲特审阅了它，并对一些内容进行了澄清。*

*(FORTUNE Magazine) – Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, almost never talks publicly about the general level of stock prices--neither in his famed annual report nor at Berkshire's thronged annual meetings nor in the rare speeches he gives. But in the past few months, on four occasions, Buffett did step up to that subject, laying out his opinions, in ways both analytical and creative, about the long-term future for stocks. FORTUNE's Carol Loomis heard the last of those talks, given in September to a group of Buffett's friends (of whom she is one), and also watched a videotape of the first speech, given in July at Allen & Co.'s Sun Valley, Idaho, bash for business leaders. From those extemporaneous talks (the first made with the Dow Jones industrial average at 11,194), Loomis distilled the following account of what Buffett said. Buffett reviewed it and weighed in with some clarifications.*

<br>

现在的股票投资者期望过高，我将解释为什么。这将不可避免地让我谈到市场整体行情，这是我通常不愿讨论的主题。但我想在一开始就明确一件事：尽管我将谈论市场的水平，我不会预测它的下一步动向。在伯克希尔，我们几乎专注于个别公司的估值，对整体市场的估值只有非常有限的关注。即使是这样，评估市场与它下周、下个月或明年将走向何方无关，这是我们从不涉足的思考方式。事实上，市场的行为方式，有时会在很长一段时间内，与价值无关。但是，迟早，价值是重要的。所以，我要说的——假设它是正确的——将对美国股票持有人实现的长期结果产生影响。

Investors in stocks these days are expecting far too much, and I'm going to explain why. That will inevitably set me to talking about the general stock market, a subject I'm usually unwilling to discuss. But I want to make one thing clear going in: Though I will be talking about the level of the market, I will not be predicting its next moves. At Berkshire we focus almost exclusively on the valuations of individual companies, looking only to a very limited extent at the valuation of the overall market. Even then, valuing the market has nothing to do with where it's going to go next week or next month or next year, a line of thought we never get into. The fact is that markets behave in ways, sometimes for a very long stretch, that are not linked to value. Sooner or later, though, value counts. So what I am going to be saying--assuming it's correct--will have implications for the long-term results to be realized by American stockholders.

<br>

首先，让我们定义一下“投资”。这个定义很简单但经常被忽视：投资就是现在投入资金，期待未来获得更多的资金回报——在考虑通胀因素后，是更多的实际资金。

Let's start by defining "investing." The definition is simple but often forgotten: Investing is laying out money now to get more money back in the future--more money in real terms, after taking inflation into account.

<br>

现在，为了获取一些历史视角，让我们回顾一下这之前的34年——在这里我们将看到一个近乎《圣经》式的对称，意味着瘦年和丰年——来观察股市发生了什么。首先，从1964年底到1981年的这17年时间，让我们看看在这个时间间隔内发生了什么：

Now, to get some historical perspective, let's look back at the 34 years before this one--and here we are going to see an almost Biblical kind of symmetry, in the sense of lean years and fat years--to observe what happened in the stock market. Take, to begin with, the first 17 years of the period, from the end of 1964 through 1981. Here's what took place in that interval:

<br>

道琼斯工业平均指数 1964年12月31日：874.12 1981年12月31日：875.00

DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE Dec. 31, 1964: 874.12 Dec. 31, 1981: 875.00

<br>

即使我以长期投资和耐心著称，但我也不认为这是大幅波动。

Now I'm known as a long-term investor and a patient guy, but that is not my idea of a big move.

<br>

另一个主要而截然不同的事实是：在同样的17年期间，美国的GDP——也就是这个国家的商业活动——几乎翻了五倍，增长了370%。或者，如果我们看另一个衡量标准，FORTUNE 500的销售（当然是不断变化的公司组合）增长了六倍多。然而，道琼斯指数却一直没有变动。

And here's a major and very opposite fact: During that same 17 years, the GDP of the U.S.--that is, the business being done in this country--almost quintupled, rising by 370%. Or, if we look at another measure, the sales of the FORTUNE 500 (a changing mix of companies, of course) more than sextupled. And yet the Dow went exactly nowhere.

<br>

为了理解为什么会这样，我们首先需要看一下影响投资结果的两个重要变量之一：利率。利率对金融估值的影响就像重力对物质的影响：利率越高，下拉的力度就越大。那是因为投资者从任何类型的投资中需要的回报率直接与他们可以从政府债券中获得的无风险利率相挂钩。因此，如果政府利率上升，所有其他投资的价格必须向下调整，以便将其预期回报率保持在一致的水平。反之，如果政府利率下降，这个动作会推高所有其他投资的价格。基本的原理是：投资者今天应该为明天将要收到的一美元支付多少钱，只能首先看一下无风险利率。

To understand why that happened, we need first to look at one of the two important variables that affect investment results: interest rates. These act on financial valuations the way gravity acts on matter: The higher the rate, the greater the downward pull. That's because the rates of return that investors need from any kind of investment are directly tied to the risk-free rate that they can earn from government securities. So if the government rate rises, the prices of all other investments must adjust downward, to a level that brings their expected rates of return into line. Conversely, if government interest rates fall, the move pushes the prices of all other investments upward. The basic proposition is this: What an investor should pay today for a dollar to be received tomorrow can only be determined by first looking at the risk-free interest rate.

<br>

因此，每当无风险利率移动一个基点（0.01%）时，该国每项投资的价值都会发生变化。人们可以很容易地在债券的情况下看到这一点，债券的价值通常只受到利率的影响。在股票、房地产、农场或其他领域的情况下，通常还有其他非常重要的变量在起作用，这意味着利率变化的影响通常被掩盖。尽管如此，这种影响就像无形的引力一样，始终存在。

Consequently, every time the risk-free rate moves by one basis point--by 0.01%--the value of every investment in the country changes. People can see this easily in the case of bonds, whose value is normally affected only by interest rates. In the case of equities or real estate or farms or whatever, other very important variables are almost always at work, and that means the effect of interest rate changes is usually obscured. Nonetheless, the effect--like the invisible pull of gravity--is constantly there.

<br>

在1964年至1981年的时期，长期政府债券利率出现了巨大增长，从1964年年末略高于4%上升到1981年末的超过15%。利率的上涨对所有投资价值产生了巨大的抑制作用，但我们当然会注意到的是股票的价格。因此，在利率的引力增加三倍的情况下，这就是为什么经济的巨大增长伴随着股市一片寂静的主要解释所在。

In the 1964-81 period, there was a tremendous increase in the rates on long-term government bonds, which moved from just over 4% at year-end 1964 to more than 15% by late 1981. That rise in rates had a huge depressing effect on the value of all investments, but the one we noticed, of course, was the price of equities. So there--in that tripling of the gravitational pull of interest rates--lies the major explanation of why tremendous growth in the economy was accompanied by a stock market going nowhere.

<br>

然后，在20世纪80年代初，情况发生了逆转。你会记得保罗·沃尔克出任美联储主席的情况，也会记得他当时是多么不受欢迎。但他所做的英勇事情——他对经济的举措和对通胀的遏制——导致了利率趋势的逆转，取得了一些相当惊人的结果。假设你在1981年11月16日购买了面值为1百万美元、利率为14%、期限为30年的美国国债，并将票息再投资。也就是说，每当你获得一笔利息支付，你用它来购买更多同一种债券。到1998年底，当时长期政府债券的利率降至5%，你将拥有8,181,219美元，并获得每年超过13%的回报率。

Then, in the early 1980s, the situation reversed itself. You will remember Paul Volcker coming in as chairman of the Fed and remember also how unpopular he was. But the heroic things he did--his taking a two-by-four to the economy and breaking the back of inflation--caused the interest rate trend to reverse, with some rather spectacular results. Let's say you put $1 million into the 14% 30-year U.S. bond issued Nov. 16, 1981, and reinvested the coupons. That is, every time you got an interest payment, you used it to buy more of that same bond. At the end of 1998, with long-term governments by then selling at 5%, you would have had $8,181,219 and would have earned an annual return of more than 13%.

<br>

这种每年13%的回报率比历史上许多17年期间股票的表现要好——事实上，在大多数17年期间都如此。这是一个了不起的结果，而且是来自一张普通的债券。

That 13% annual return is better than stocks have done in a great many 17-year periods in history--in most 17-year periods, in fact. It was a helluva result, and from none other than a stodgy bond.

<br>

利率的影响力也推动了股票的上涨，尽管其他因素也起到了额外的推动作用，我们接下来会提到这些因素。在同样的17年时间里，股票的表现如下：如果你在1981年11月16日投资了100万美元在道琼斯指数，并将所有股息再投资，你到1998年12月31日将拥有19,720,112美元。你的年回报率将达到19%。

The power of interest rates had the effect of pushing up equities as well, though other things that we will get to pushed additionally. And so here's what equities did in that same 17 years: If you'd invested $1 million in the Dow on Nov. 16, 1981, and reinvested all dividends, you'd have had $19,720,112 on Dec. 31, 1998. And your annual return would have been 19%.

<br>

自1981年以来，股票价值的增长超过了历史上任何时期的表现。这个增长甚至超过了你在1932年购买股票的情况——当时正值经济大萧条，最低点是1932年7月8日，道琼斯指数收于41.22点——并持有它们17年的情况。

The increase in equity values since 1981 beats anything you can find in history. This increase even surpasses what you would have realized if you'd bought stocks in 1932, at their Depression bottom--on its lowest day, July 8, 1932, the Dow closed at 41.22--and held them for 17 years.

第二个影响这17年股票价格的因素是税后企业利润，这张图表显示了税后企业利润占GDP的百分比。实际上，这张图表告诉你的是美国企业股东每年从GDP中获得了多少份额。

The second thing bearing on stock prices during this 17 years was after-tax corporate profits, which this chart [above] displays as a percentage of GDP. In effect, what this chart tells you is what portion of the GDP ended up every year with the shareholders of American business.

<p class="small">原文标题： Warren Buffett On The Stock Market What's in the future for investors--another roaring bull market or more upset stomach? Amazingly, the answer may come down to three simple factors. Here, the world's most celebrated investor talks about what really makes the market tick--and whether that ticking should make you nervous.</p>



[cnn](https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2001/12/10/314691/)

<br>

*《财富》杂志 - 两年前，伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司的董事长沃伦·巴菲特在1999年7月的一次演讲中谈到了股市 —— 这对他来说是一个很少公开讨论的主题。《财富》随后刊登了他的发言，标题为《巴菲特先生谈股市》（1999年11月22日）。当时，他的主要观点涉及到美国投资者经历的两个连续且惊人的时期，以及他认为股票收益将大幅下降的观点。自从他发表演讲时道琼斯工业平均指数为11194，而最近该指数约为9900，因此还没有人能够反驳他。*

*(FORTUNE Magazine) – Two years ago, following a July 1999 speech by Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, on the stock market--a rare subject for him to discuss publicly--FORTUNE ran what he had to say under the title "Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market" (Nov. 22, 1999). His main points then concerned two consecutive and amazing periods that American investors had experienced, and his belief that returns from stocks were due to fall dramatically. Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 11194 when he gave his speech and recently was about 9900, no one yet has the goods to argue with him.*

<br>

*那么，我们现在的状况是什么呢？股市似乎反映出了黯淡的利润前景、一场陌生的战争以及受到冲击的消费者信心。对于这个问题，有谁比巴菲特更能提供深刻的见解呢？*

*So where do we stand now--with the stock market seeming to reflect a dismal profit outlook, an unfamiliar war, and rattled consumer confidence? Who better to supply perspective on that question than Buffett?*

<br>

*以下的观点来自巴菲特的第二次演讲，于去年7月在第一次演讲的地点 —— 艾伦公司为企业高管举办的年度太阳谷盛会 —— 发表。在那里，这位著名的股票投资专家回顾了之前讨论过的主题，并为这个话题带来了新的数据和见解。在与《财富》杂志的Carol Loomis合作下，巴菲特将这次演讲提炼成了这篇文章，为今年的投资者指南创作了一个恰当的开篇。以下是巴菲特先生再次谈论股市。*

*The thoughts that follow come from a second Buffett speech, given last July at the site of the first talk, Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley bash for corporate executives. There, the renowned stockpicker returned to the themes he'd discussed before, bringing new data and insights to the subject. Working with FORTUNE's Carol Loomis, Buffett distilled that speech into this essay, a fitting opening for this year's Investor's Guide. Here again is Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market.*

<br>

上一次我谈论这个主题是在1999年，当时我将之前的34年分为两个17年时期，从瘦年和丰年的角度来看，它们呈现出惊人的对称性。以下是第一个时期。如你所见，17年间道指涨幅仅为0.1%。

The last time I tackled this subject, in 1999, I broke down the previous 34 years into two 17-year periods, which in the sense of lean years and fat were astonishingly symmetrical. Here's the first period. As you can see, over 17 years the Dow gained exactly one-tenth of one percent.

<br>

道琼斯工业平均指数

1964年12月31日：874.12

1981年12月31日：875.00

Dow Jones Industrial Average

Dec. 31, 1964: 874.12

Dec. 31, 1981: 875.00

<br>

以下是第二个时期，以一场令人难以置信的牛市为特点，当我阐述我的观点时，这个牛市即将结束（尽管我当时并不知道）。

And here's the second, marked by an incredible bull market that, as I laid out my thoughts, was about to end (though I didn't know that).

<br>

道琼斯工业平均指数

1981年12月31日：875.00

1998年12月31日：9181.43

Dow Jones Industrial Average

Dec. 31, 1981: 875.00

Dec. 31, 1998: 9181.43

<br>

现在，你不能通过比如说国民生产总值增长的差异来解释市场之间这种显著的分歧。在第一个时期——市场表现低迷的时期——国民生产总值的增长实际上比第二个时期快了两倍多。

Now, you couldn't explain this remarkable divergence in markets by, say, differences in the growth of gross national product. In the first period--that dismal time for the market--GNP actually grew more than twice as fast as it did in the second period.

<br>

国民生产总值增长

1964-1981年：373%

1981-1998年：177%

Gain in Gross National Product

1964-1981: 373%

1981-1988: 177%

<br>

那么原因是什么呢？我得出的结论是，市场的对比变动是由两个关键经济变量的非凡变化以及与之相关的心理因素最终发挥作用所导致的。

So what was the explanation? I concluded that the market's contrasting moves were caused by extraordinary changes in two critical economic variables--and by a related psychological force that eventually came into play.

<br>

在此，我需要提醒您关于“投资”的定义，尽管简单，但常常被遗忘。投资就是今天花钱，以便明天能收到更多的钱。

Here I need to remind you about the definition of "investing," which though simple is often forgotten. Investing is laying out money today to receive more money tomorrow.

<br>

这引出了影响两个时期股票价格的第一个经济变量 — 利率。在经济学中，利率的作用类似于物理世界中的重力。在任何时候、任何市场、世界各地，利率的微小变化都会改变每一种金融资产的价值。您可以清楚地从债券价格的波动中看到这一点。但这个规律同样适用于农田、石油储备、股票以及其他所有金融资产。而且利率对价值的影响可能是巨大的。例如，如果利率是13%，那么您未来从投资中获得的一美元的现值就不会像利率为4%时的一美元现值那么高。

That gets to the first of the economic variables that affected stock prices in the two periods--interest rates. In economics, interest rates act as gravity behaves in the physical world. At all times, in all markets, in all parts of the world, the tiniest change in rates changes the value of every financial asset. You see that clearly with the fluctuating prices of bonds. But the rule applies as well to farmland, oil reserves, stocks, and every other financial asset. And the effects can be huge on values. If interest rates are, say, 13%, the present value of a dollar that you're going to receive in the future from an investment is not nearly as high as the present value of a dollar if rates are 4%.

<br>

利率，长期国债

1964年12月31日：4.20%

1981年12月31日：13.65%

1998年12月31日：5.09%

Interest rates, Long-term government bonds

Dec. 31, 1964: 4.20%

Dec. 31, 1981: 13.65%

Dec. 31, 1998: 5.09%

<br>

另一个关键变量是投资者预期从投资公司中获得多少美元。在第一个时期，由于企业利润表现不佳，预期大幅下降。实际上，到1980年代初，美联储主席保罗·沃尔克的经济大锤使企业盈利降至自1930年代以来的最低水平。

The other critical variable here is how many dollars investors expected to get from the companies in which they invested. During the first period expectations fell significantly because corporate profits weren't looking good. By the early 1980s Fed Chairman Paul Volcker's economic sledgehammer had, in fact, driven corporate profitability to a level that people hadn't seen since the 1930s.

<br>

结果是投资者对美国经济失去了信心：他们认为未来将受到两个负面因素的困扰。首先，他们没有看到公司利润有多少好转。其次，当时的高利率使他们进一步对微薄的利润进行折价。这两个因素共同作用，导致 1964 年至 1981 年间股市停滞不前，尽管这些年国民生产总值取得了巨大进步。国家的企业在增长，而投资者对该企业的估值却在缩水！

The upshot is that investors lost their confidence in the American economy: They were looking at a future they believed would be plagued by two negatives. First, they didn't see much good coming in the way of corporate profits. Second, the sky-high interest rates prevailing caused them to discount those meager profits further. These two factors, working together, caused stagnation in the stock market from 1964 to 1981, even though those years featured huge improvements in GNP. The business of the country grew while investors' valuation of that business shrank!

<br>

随后，这些因素发生了逆转，在此期间，国民生产总值的增幅大大降低，但市场却获得了丰厚的回报。首先，盈利率大幅提高。其次，利率大幅下降，使得一美元的未来利润变得更有价值。这两种现象都是推动大牛市的真实而有力的因素。随着时间的推移，我提到的心理因素也加入了这个等式： 投机交易爆炸性增长，原因很简单，因为人们看到了市场行为。稍后，我们将探讨这种危险且经常出现的弊病的病理。

And then the reversal of those factors created a period during which much lower GNP gains were accompanied by a bonanza for the market. First, you got a major increase in the rate of profitability. Second, you got an enormous drop in interest rates, which made a dollar of future profit that much more valuable. Both phenomena were real and powerful fuels for a major bull market. And in time the psychological factor I mentioned was added to the equation: Speculative trading exploded, simply because of the market action that people had seen. Later, we'll look at the pathology of this dangerous and oft-recurring malady.

<br>

两年前，我相信有利的基本趋势已基本结束。如果市场要从当时的水平大幅上涨，就需要长期利率进一步下降（这总是有可能的），或者企业盈利能力有重大改善（当时看来，这似乎是相当大的）。可能性较小）。如果你看一下 50 年税后利润占国内生产总值 (GDP) 百分比的图表，你会发现该比率通常落在 4% 之间（例如 1981 年经济不景气时的水平） - 和 6.5%。利率超过 6.5% 的情况很少见。在1999年和2000年利润非常好的年份，这一比率低于6%，而今年很可能会降至5%以下。

Two years ago I believed the favorable fundamental trends had largely run their course. For the market to go dramatically up from where it was then would have required long-term interest rates to drop much further (which is always possible) or for there to be a major improvement in corporate profitability (which seemed, at the time, considerably less possible). If you take a look at a 50-year chart of after-tax profits as a percent of gross domestic product, you find that the rate normally falls between 4%--that was its neighborhood in the bad year of 1981, for example--and 6.5%. For the rate to go above 6.5% is rare. In the very good profit years of 1999 and 2000, the rate was under 6% and this year it may well fall below 5%.

<br>

这就是我对这两个截然不同的 17 年的解释。问题是，市场过去的这些时期对其未来有多大影响？

So there you have my explanation of those two wildly different 17-year periods. The question is, How much do those periods of the past for the market say about its future?

<br>

为了给出答案，我想回顾一下 20 世纪。如您所知，这确实是美国世纪。我们有了汽车、飞机、收音机、电视和电脑。那是一段令人难以置信的时期。事实上，以实际美元衡量（即不受通货膨胀影响），美国的人均产出增长率达到惊人的 702%。

To suggest an answer, I'd like to look back over the 20th century. As you know, this was really the American century. We had the advent of autos, we had aircraft, we had radio, TV, and computers. It was an incredible period. Indeed, the per capita growth in U.S. output, measured in real dollars (that is, with no impact from inflation), was a breathtaking 702%.

<br>

当然，本世纪也有一些非常艰难的年份，例如 1929 年至 1933 年的大萧条时期。但对人均 GNP 的十年观察显示出一些值得注意的事情：作为一个国家，我们在整个世纪中取得了相对一致的进步。因此，您可能会认为美国的经济价值（至少按照其证券市场来衡量）也会以相当一致的速度增长。

The century included some very tough years, of course--like the Depression years of 1929 to 1933. But a decade-by-decade look at per capita GNP shows something remarkable: As a nation, we made relatively consistent progress throughout the century. So you might think that the economic value of the U.S.--at least as measured by its securities markets--would have grown at a reasonably consistent pace as well.

事实并非如此。从我们之前对 1964-98 年时期的考察中我们知道，并行性在那个时代完全崩溃了。但整个世纪也证明了这一点。例如，在建国初期，即 1900 年至 1920 年间，这个国家一路向前，爆炸性地扩大了电力、汽车和电话的使用。然而市场几乎没有变化，年增长率为 0.4%，大致相当于 1964 年至 1981 年间的微薄采收。

That's not what happened. We know from our earlier examination of the 1964-98 period that parallelism broke down completely in that era. But the whole century makes this point as well. At its beginning, for example, between 1900 and 1920, the country was chugging ahead, explosively expanding its use of electricity, autos, and the telephone. Yet the market barely moved, recording a 0.4% annual increase that was roughly analogous to the slim pickings between 1964 and 1981.

<p class="small">原文标题：Derivatives</p>

<br>

查理和我对衍生品及其相关的交易活动的看法是一致的：我们认为它们是定时炸弹，不仅对参与其中的各方，也对整个经济体系。

Charlie and I are of one mind in how we feel about derivatives and the trading activities that go with them: We view them as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system.

<br>

在回到这个想法之前，让我先来解释一下衍生品，虽然这个解释必须是很笼统的，因为这个词涵盖了非常广泛的金融合约。基本上，这些工具要求在未来某个日期交换金钱，交换的金额由一个或多个参考项目决定，比如利率、股票价格或货币价值。例如，如果你是标准普尔500期货合约的多头或空头，你就是一个非常简单的衍生品交易的一方——你的盈亏取决于指数的变动。衍生品合约的期限不同（有时长达20年或更长），它们的价值通常与多个变量相关。 

Having delivered that thought, which I’ll get back to, let me retreat to explaining derivatives, though the explanation must be general because the word covers an extraordinarily wide range of financial contracts. Essentially, these instruments call for money to change hands at some future date, with the amount to be determined by one or more reference items, such as interest rates, stock prices, or currency values. If, for example, you are either long or short an S&P 500 futures contract, you are a party to a very simple derivatives transaction--with your gain or loss derived from movements in the index. Derivatives contracts are of varying duration (running sometimes to 20 or more years), and their value is often tied to several variables.

<br>

除非衍生品合约有抵押或担保，否则它们的最终价值也取决于交易对手的信用状况。与此同时，在合约结算之前，交易对手会在他们的当前收益报表中记录利润和损失——通常是巨额的——而没有一分钱的现金流动。

Unless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties to them. In the meantime, though, before a contract is settled, the counterparties record profits and losses--often huge in amount--in their current earnings statements without so much as a penny changing hands.

<br>

衍生品合约的种类只受制于人类（或有时，看起来是疯子）的想象力。例如，在安然公司，一些要在未来多年结算的新闻纸和宽带衍生品被记入账簿。或者说你想写一份合约，来投机2020年在内布拉斯加州出生的双胞胎的数量。没问题——只要出个价，你就会很容易地找到一个愿意合作的对手。

The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen). At Enron, for example, newsprint and broadband derivatives, due to be settled many years in the future, were put on the books. Or say you want to write a contract speculating on the number of twins to be born in Nebraska in 2020. No problem--at a price, you will easily find an obliging counterparty.

<br>

当我们购买了通用再保险公司时，它附带了一个我们不想要的衍生品交易商，通用再保险证券公司。我和查理认为这是危险的。然而，我们在出售这个业务的尝试中失败了，现在正在终止它。

When we purchased Gen Re, it came with General Re Securities, a derivatives dealer that Charlie and I didn’t want, judging it to be dangerous. We failed in our attempts to sell the operation, however, and are now terminating it.

<br>

但是关闭一个衍生品业务并不是说说而已。在我们完全退出这个业务之前（尽管我们每天都在减少我们的风险敞口），还需要很多年的时间。事实上，再保险和衍生品业务是相似的：像地狱一样，两者都很容易进入，几乎无法退出。在这两个行业中，一旦你写了一个合同——可能在几十年后需要支付一笔巨额款项——你通常就被卡住了。当然，有一些方法可以把风险转嫁给其他人。但是大多数这样的策略都会给你留下残余的责任。

But closing down a derivatives business is easier said than done. It will be a great many years before we are totally out of this operation (though we reduce our exposure daily). In fact, the reinsurance and derivatives businesses are similar: Like Hell, both are easy to enter and almost impossible to exit. In either industry, once you write a contract--which may require a large payment decades later--you are usually stuck with it. True, there are methods by which the risk can be laid off with others. But most strategies of that kind leave you with residual liability.

<br>

再保险和衍生品的另一个共同点是，它们都会产生经常被大大夸大的报告收益。这是因为今天的收益在很大程度上是基于估计，而这些估计的不准确性可能要等到多年后才能暴露出来。

Another commonality of reinsurance and derivatives is that both generate reported earnings that are often wildly overstated. That’s true because today’s earnings are in a significant way based on estimates whose inaccuracy may not be exposed for many years.

<br>

错误通常是诚实的，只反映了人类倾向于对自己的承诺持乐观态度的特点。但是，衍生品的交易方也有巨大的动机在会计上作弊。交易衍生品的人通常是根据按市场价计算的“收益”来支付（全部或部分）的。但是，往往没有真正的市场（想想我们涉及双胞胎的合同），而是使用“按模型计算”。这种替代可能会引发大规模的恶作剧。一般来说，涉及多个参考项目和遥远结算日期的合同增加了交易对手使用荒诞假设的机会。例如，在双胞胎的情景中，合同的双方可能会使用不同的模型，使他们都能显示出多年来的可观利润。在极端情况下，按模型计算退化为我所称的按神话计算。

Errors will usually be honest, reflecting only the human tendency to take an optimistic view of one’s commitments. But the parties to derivatives also have enormous incentives to cheat in accounting for them. Those who trade derivatives are usually paid (in whole or part) on “earnings” calculated by mark-to-market accounting. But often there is no real market (think about our contract involving twins) and “mark-to-model” is utilized. This substitution can bring on large-scale mischief. As a general rule, contracts involving multiple reference items and distant settlement dates increase the opportunities for counterparties to use fanciful assumptions. In the twins scenario, for example, the two parties to the contract might well use differing models allowing both to show substantial profits for many years. In extreme cases, mark-to-model degenerates into what I would call mark-to-myth.

<br>

当然，内部和外部的审计师都会审查这些数字，但这并不是一件容易的工作。例如，年底时（在停止运营十个月后），General Re Securities有14,384份合同未结清，涉及世界各地的672个交易对手。每份合同都有一个正负值，由一个或多个参考项目决定，其中一些非常复杂。对于这样的投资组合，即使是专业的审计师，也可能会诚实地有很大的意见分歧。

Of course, both internal and outside auditors review the numbers, but that’s no easy job. For example, General Re Securities at year-end (after ten months of winding down its operation) had 14,384 contracts outstanding, involving 672 counterparties around the world. Each contract had a plus or minus value derived from one or more reference items, including some of mind-boggling complexity. Valuing a portfolio like that, expert auditors could easily and honestly have widely varying opinions.

<br>

估值问题远非学术性的：近年来，一些巨大规模的欺诈和近乎欺诈的行为都是通过衍生品交易促成的。例如，在能源和电力行业，一些公司利用衍生品和交易活动来报告巨大的“收益”——直到他们试图把资产负债表上与衍生品相关的应收账款兑换成现金时，屋顶塌了。“按市场价值计算”结果变成了真正的“按幻想计算”。

The valuation problem is far from academic: In recent years some huge-scale frauds and near-frauds have been facilitated by derivatives trades. In the energy and electric utility sectors, for example, companies used derivatives and trading activities to report great “earnings”--until the roof fell in when they actually tried to convert the derivatives-related receivables on their balance sheets into cash. “Mark-to-market” then turned out to be truly “mark-to-myth.”

<br>

我可以向你保证，衍生品业务中的标记错误并不对称。几乎总是有利于那些想要获得数百万美元奖金的交易员或者想要报告令人印象深刻的“收益”的首席执行官（或者两者兼而有之）。奖金已经发放，首席执行官也从他的期权中获利。只有在很久以后，股东们才知道所谓的收益是虚假的。

I can assure you that the marking errors in the derivatives business have not been symmetrical. Almost invariably, they have favored either the trader who was eyeing a multimillion-dollar bonus or the CEO who wanted to report impressive “earnings” (or both). The bonuses were paid, and the CEO profited from his options. Only much later did shareholders learn that the reported earnings were a sham.

<br>

另一个关于衍生品的问题是，它们可能会加剧一个公司因为完全无关的原因陷入的麻烦。这种叠加效应是因为许多衍生品合约要求一个公司在信用评级下降时立即向对手方提供担保。想象一下，一个公司因为普遍的逆境而被降级，而它的衍生品立即发挥作用，对公司提出了意想不到的巨大的现金担保需求。满足这种需求可能会使公司陷入流动性危机，而在某些情况下，可能会引发更多的降级。这就变成了一个螺旋，可能导致公司崩溃。

Another problem about derivatives is that they can exacerbate trouble that a corporation has run into for completely unrelated reasons. This pile-on effect occurs because many derivatives contracts require that a company suffering a credit downgrade immediately supply collateral to counterparties. Imagine, then, that a company is downgraded because of general adversity and that its derivatives instantly kick in with their requirement, imposing an unexpected and enormous demand for cash collateral on the company. The need to meet this demand can then throw the company into a liquidity crisis that may, in some cases, trigger still more downgrades. It all becomes a spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown.

<br>

衍生品也会产生一种像保险公司或再保险公司那样的风险，他们把自己的业务大部分转给别人。在这两种情况下，随着时间的推移，都会积累起来自许多交易对手的巨额应收账款。（在Gen Re Securities，我们仍然有65亿美元的应收账款，尽管我们已经处于清算模式将近一年了。）一个参与者可能认为自己是谨慎的，认为他的大额信用风险是分散的，因此不危险。然而，在某些情况下，一个外部事件导致来自公司A的应收账款变坏，也会影响来自公司B到Z的应收账款。历史教导我们，危机往往会导致问题以一种在更平静的时期无法想象的方式相关联。

Derivatives also create a daisy-chain risk that is akin to the risk run by insurers or reinsurers that lay off much of their business with others. In both cases, huge receivables from many counterparties tend to build up over time. (At Gen Re Securities, we still have $6.5 billion of receivables, though we’ve been in a liquidation mode for nearly a year.) A participant may see himself as prudent, believing his large credit exposures to be diversified and therefore not dangerous. Under certain circumstances, though, an exogenous event that causes the receivable from Company A to go bad will also affect those from Companies B through Z. History teaches us that a crisis often causes problems to correlate in a manner undreamed of in more tranquil times.

<br>

在银行业，认识到“联系”问题是建立美联储系统的原因之一。在美联储成立之前，弱势银行的倒闭有时会对之前强势的银行造成突然和意外的流动性需求，导致它们也相继倒闭。美联储现在将强势的银行与弱势的银行隔离开来。但是没有一个中央银行负责防止保险或衍生品行业中的多米诺骨牌效应。在这些行业中，本来坚实的公司可能仅仅因为链条上其他公司的困境而陷入麻烦。当一个行业存在“连锁反应”威胁时，最好尽量减少任何形式的联系。这就是我们经营再保险业务的方式，也是我们退出衍生品业务的原因之一。

In banking, the recognition of a “linkage” problem was one of the reasons for the formation of the Federal Reserve System. Before the Fed was established, the failure of weak banks would sometimes put sudden and unanticipated liquidity demands on previously strong banks, causing them to fail in turn. The Fed now insulates the strong from the troubles of the weak. But there is no central bank assigned to the job of preventing the dominoes toppling in insurance or derivatives. In these industries, firms that are fundamentally solid can become troubled simply because of the travails of other firms further down the chain. When a “chain reaction” threat exists within an industry, it pays to minimize links of any kind. That’s how we conduct our reinsurance business, and it’s one reason we are exiting derivatives.

<br>

很多人认为，衍生品可以减少系统性风险，因为那些不能承受某些风险的参与者可以把它们转移给更强大的人。这些人相信，衍生品可以稳定经济，促进贸易，消除个别参与者的波动。在微观层面上，他们说的往往是对的。事实上，在伯克希尔，我有时会进行大规模的衍生品交易，以便实施某些投资策略。

Many people argue that derivatives reduce systemic problems, in that participants who can’t bear certain risks are able to transfer them to stronger hands. These people believe that derivatives act to stabilize the economy, facilitate trade, and eliminate bumps for individual participants. And, on a micro level, what they say is often true. Indeed, at Berkshire, I sometimes engage in large-scale derivatives transactions in order to facilitate certain investment strategies.

<br>

查理和我相信，宏观形势很危险，而且越来越危险。大量的风险，特别是信用风险，集中在相对少数的衍生品交易商手中，而且他们之间还进行着广泛的交易。其中一个人的麻烦可能很快感染其他人。除此之外，这些交易商还向非交易商对手方借出了巨额资金。其中一些对手方，正如我所提到的，由于某个单一事件（例如电信行业的崩溃或商业电力项目价值的急剧下降）而可能同时遇到问题。一旦联系暴露出来，就可能引发严重的系统性问题。

Charlie and I believe, however, that the macro picture is dangerous and getting more so. Large amounts of risk, particularly credit risk, have become concentrated in the hands of relatively few derivatives dealers, who in addition trade extensively with one another. The troubles of one could quickly infect the others. On top of that, these dealers are owed huge amounts by nondealer counterparties. Some of these counterparties, as I’ve mentioned, are linked in ways that could cause them to contemporaneously run into a problem because of a single event (such as the implosion of the telecom industry or the precipitous decline in the value of merchant power projects). Linkage, when it suddenly surfaces, can trigger serious systemic problems.

<br>

事实上，在1998年，一个单一的、使用杠杆和衍生品的对冲基金，长期资本管理公司（Long-Term Capital Management），给美联储造成了如此严重的焦虑，以至于它匆忙地策划了一次救援行动。在后来的国会证词中，美联储官员承认，如果他们没有干预，LTCM的未结交易——一个公众不知道的公司，只雇佣了几百人——很可能对美国市场的稳定构成严重威胁。换句话说，美联储之所以采取行动，是因为它的领导人担心如果LTCM这枚多米诺骨牌倒下，其他金融机构会发生什么。而这件事，尽管它让许多固定收益市场陷入了数周的瘫痪，但远非最坏的情况 。

Indeed, in 1998, the leveraged and derivatives-heavy activities of a single hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, caused the Federal Reserve anxieties so severe that it hastily orchestrated a rescue effort. In later congressional testimony, Fed officials acknowledged that, had they not intervened, the outstanding trades of LTCM--a firm unknown to the general public and employing only a few hundred people--could well have posed a serious threat to the stability of American markets. In other words, the Fed acted because its leaders were fearful of what might have happened to other financial institutions had the LTCM domino toppled. And this affair, though it paralyzed many parts of the fixed-income market for weeks, was far from a worst-case scenario.

<br>

LTCM使用的衍生品工具之一是总回报互换，这是一种合约，可以在各种市场（包括股票）实现100%的杠杆率。例如，合约的一方（通常是银行）为购买股票提供所有资金，而另一方（不提供任何资本）同意在未来的某个日期接收或支付银行实现的任何收益或损失。

One of the derivatives instruments that LTCM used was total-return swaps, contracts that facilitate 100% leverage in various markets, including stocks. For example, Party A to a contract, usually a bank, puts up all of the money for the purchase of a stock, while Party B, without putting up any capital, agrees that at a future date it will receive any gain or pay any loss that the bank realizes.

<br>

这种类型的总回报互换让保证金要求成了一个笑话。除此之外，其他类型的衍生品严重削弱了监管机构控制杠杆和了解银行、保险公司和其他金融机构的风险状况的能力。同样，即使是经验丰富的投资者和分析师，在分析那些与衍生品合约密切相关的公司的财务状况时也会遇到重大问题。当查理（Charlie）和我读完主要银行详细说明其衍生品活动的冗长脚注时，我们唯一明白的是，我们不明白这些机构承担了多少风险。

Total-return swaps of this type make a joke of margin requirements. Beyond that, other types of derivatives severely curtail the ability of regulators to curb leverage and generally get their arms around the risk profiles of banks, insurers, and other financial institutions. Similarly, even experienced investors and analysts encounter major problems in analyzing the financial condition of firms that are heavily involved with derivatives contracts. When Charlie and I finish reading the long footnotes detailing the derivatives activities of major banks, the only thing we understand is that we don’t understand how much risk the institution is running.

<br>

衍生品的精灵已经从瓶子里出来了，这些工具几乎肯定会在种类和数量上不断增加，直到某个事件让它们的毒性显现出来。它们有多危险的知识已经渗透到电力和天然气行业，这些行业爆发的重大问题导致了衍生品的使用大幅减少。然而，在其他地方，衍生品业务仍然不受控制地扩张。央行和政府迄今为止还没有找到有效的方法来控制或监测这些合约所带来的风险。

The derivatives genie is now well out of the bottle, and these instruments will almost certainly multiply in variety and number until some event makes their toxicity clear. Knowledge of how dangerous they are has already permeated the electricity and gas businesses, in which the eruption of major troubles caused the use of derivatives to diminish dramatically. Elsewhere, however, the derivatives business continues to expand unchecked. Central banks and governments have so far found no effective way to control, or even monitor, the risks posed by these contracts.

<br>

查理和我相信，伯克希尔哈撒韦应该是一个金融坚固的堡垒——为了我们的股东、债权人、保单持有人和员工的利益。我们试图警惕任何可能发生的超级灾难风险，这种态度可能让我们过于担心长期衍生品合约的增长数量和与之相伴的大量无担保应收账款。然而，在我们看来，衍生品是金融大规模杀伤性武器，携带着潜在的致命危险，尽管现在还没有显现出来。

Charlie and I believe Berkshire should be a fortress of financial strength--for the sake of our owners, creditors, policyholders, and employees. We try to be alert to any sort of mega-catastrophe risk, and that posture may make us unduly apprehensive about the burgeoning quantities of long- term derivatives contracts and the massive amount of uncollateralized receivables that are growing alongside. In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.

<p class="small">来源：Berkshire Hathaway Letters to Shareholders, 2007</p>
<p class="small">原文标题：Business - The Great, the Good and the Gruesome</p>

<br>

我在这里和大家谈一谈我们伯克希尔哈撒韦喜欢投资的那些商业模式吧。而且，既然我们已经提到了这个话题，也和大家说说我们尝试不去涉足的商业模式。

Let’s take a look at what kind of businesses turn us on. And while we’re at it, let’s also discuss what we wish to avoid.

<br>

**查理和我看中公司的以下特点：a） 使用的是我们能读懂的商业模式，b）有利的长期经济前景，c）称职的，可依赖的管理层，d）合理的投资价格。**我们倾向于买下整个公司，或者，如果管理层是我们的伙伴的话，买下至少80%的股份。但是，在以控股形式投资优秀公司的方式不可行的情况下，我们也会在股票市场上，买下优秀公司的一小部分股份。和别人共享希望钻石也总归好过拥有一整块人造水晶。（译者注：希望钻石是世界上最著名的钻石之一，其带有诅咒的传说使得参观它的游客络绎不绝）

Charlie and I look for companies that have a) a business we understand; b) favorable long-term economics; c) able and trustworthy management; and d) a sensible price tag. We like to buy the whole business or, if management is our partner, at least 80%. When control-type purchases of quality aren’t available, though, we are also happy to simply buy small portions of great businesses by way of stockmarket purchases. It’s better to have a part interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone.

<br>

一个真正意义上的优秀企业应该有持久的“护城河”以保护其杰出的收益能力。**资本主义的动荡本质使得任何能提供高额收益的商业“城堡”会反复地被竞争者们攻击。**所以拥有一个强大的壁垒是长期成功的要素，比如该公司能够成为行业中领先的低成本经营者（政府员工保险公司，好市多），或者拥有强大的全球品牌效应（可口可丽，吉列，美国运通）。商业史中充满着“礼花弹烟花”式的公司，其护城河被时间证明是仅仅是幻影，最终被竞争者轻松跨越。

A truly great business must have an enduring “moat” that protects excellent returns on invested capital. The dynamics of capitalism guarantee that competitors will repeatedly assault any business “castle” that is earning high returns. Therefore a formidable barrier such as a company’s being the lowcost producer (GEICO, Costco) or possessing a powerful world-wide brand (Coca-Cola, Gillette, American Express) is essential for sustained success. Business history is filled with “Roman Candles,” companies whose moats proved illusory and were soon crossed.

<br>

**我们对于“持久”的评判标准使得我们剔除掉了那些更替迅速并持续变化的领域。**尽管资本主义的“创造性破坏力”对于整个社会来说是高度有利的，对于投资收益的确定性却是有害的。一个必须持续重建的护城河最终还是会变得不复存在的。

Our criterion of “enduring” causes us to rule out companies in industries prone to rapid and continuous change. Though capitalism’s “creative destruction” is highly beneficial for society, it precludes investment certainty. A moat that must be continuously rebuilt will eventually be no moat at all.

<br>

**同时，我们的评判标准也剔除了那些需要优秀的管理者才能成功的企业。**当然啦，一个优秀的CEO对于任何企业而言都是巨大的财富。伯克希尔有大量这样优秀的管理者。相对于普通CEO，他们能为公司产生数十亿的附加价值。

Additionally, this criterion eliminates the business whose success depends on having a great manager. Of course, a terrific CEO is a huge asset for any enterprise, and at Berkshire we have an abundance of these managers. Their abilities have created billions of dollars of value that would never have materialized if typical CEOs had been running their businesses.

<br>

但是如果需要一个明星式的人物才能经营好的公司，其本身很难会被成为优秀。**一个由某位当地优秀脑外科课医生牵头合伙经营的医疗站可能能够带来超常的增长型收益，但是这并不代表未来也会这样。如果这位外科医生一但离开，这个医疗站的护城河也不复存在。**不过，你可以期望的是，哪怕你叫不出马约诊所的CEO的名字，其机构本身的护城河依然能够持久存在。（译者注：马约诊所是全世界最成功的医疗机构之一）

But if a business requires a superstar to produce great results, the business itself cannot be deemed great. A medical partnership led by your area’s premier brain surgeon may enjoy outsized and growing earnings, but that tells little about its future. The partnership’s moat will go when the surgeon goes. You can count, though, on the moat of the Mayo Clinic to endure, even though you can’t name its CEO.

<br>

我们在商业模式中寻找的是能立足于稳定行业的长期的竞争优势。如果能在此之上产生高速有机增长，那就更好了。但是即使没有高速的有机增长，这样的商业模式的回报依然明显。这种情况下我们会将其丰盛的收益用于投资其他相似的企业。**并没有人规定你收益只能用于投资原来的公司本身。实际上，这么做常常是错误的根源：真正优秀的公司，在仅利用其自身的有形资产的前提下，难以持久的带来高额收益。**

Long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry is what we seek in a business. If that comes with rapid organic growth, great. But even without organic growth, such a business is rewarding. We will simply take the lush earnings of the business and use them to buy similar businesses elsewhere. There’s no rule that you have to invest money where you’ve earned it. Indeed, it’s often a mistake to do so: Truly great businesses, earning huge returns on tangible assets, can’t for any extended period reinvest a large portion of their earnings internally at high rates of return.

<br>

### 优秀的商业模式 THE GREAT

让大家先看看理想型的商业模式的雏形吧，我们的喜诗糖果店。盒装巧克力行业本身并不是令人激动的事物：美国的人均巧克力食用量相当低，而且没有增长。很多红极一时的品牌都消失了，幸存下来的三家公司在过去40年的利润也是杯水车薪。实际上，我相信喜诗糖果，虽然表面上只是在美国几个大州中销售巧克力，实际上赚取的利润快赶上整个行业一半的利润总额了。

Let’s look at the prototype of a dream business, our own See’s Candy. The boxed-chocolates industry in which it operates is unexciting: Per-capita consumption in the U.S. is extremely low and doesn’t grow. Many once-important brands have disappeared, and only three companies have earned more than token profits over the last forty years. Indeed, I believe that See’s, though it obtains the bulk of its revenues from only a few states, accounts for nearly half of the entire industry’s earnings.

<br>

1972年，被年蓝筹印花收购的那年，喜诗糖果店的年度销售额为1600万磅糖果（译者注：约为7257.49吨）（那时候查理和我管理着蓝筹印花，随后被伯克希尔收购）。去年喜诗卖出了3100万磅糖果（译者注：约为14061.36吨），增长率只有每年2%。然而，由于经历了喜诗家族50年的经营，还有后来查克·哈金斯以及布拉德·金斯特勒的进一步强化，喜诗糖果的持久的竞争优势为伯克希尔带来了非凡的收益。

At See’s, annual sales were 16 million pounds of candy when Blue Chip Stamps purchased the company in 1972. (Charlie and I controlled Blue Chip at the time and later merged it into Berkshire.) Last year See’s sold 31 million pounds, a growth rate of only 2% annually. Yet its durable competitive advantage, built by the See’s family over a 50-year period, and strengthened subsequently by Chuck Huggins and Brad Kinstler, has produced extraordinary results for Berkshire.

<br>

在我们以2500万收购的当时，喜诗糖果有3000万的年销售额和低于500万的税前收益。当时经营需要的资本为800万。（每年有几个月需要一定程度的季节性贷款。）伴随而来的是每年60%的税前投入资本收益。**有两个要素降低了喜诗糖果的经营资本需求。第一点是产品都是以现金交易，不存在应收账款。第二点是生产和分销的周期短，最小化了库存。**

We bought See’s for $25 million when its sales were $30 million and pre-tax earnings were less than $5 million. The capital then required to conduct the business was $8 million. (Modest seasonal debt was also needed for a few months each year.) Consequently, the company was earning 60% pre-tax on invested capital. Two factors helped to minimize the funds required for operations. First, the product was sold for cash, and that eliminated accounts receivable. Second, the production and distribution cycle was short, which minimized inventories.

<br>

去年喜诗的销售额是3.83亿，税前利润是8200万。现在每年需要的经营资本为4000万。这意味着自从1972年起，我们只需要再投资3200万即可保持可观的增长率，以及一定规模的收益增长率。与此同时，税前收益共计达到了135亿。这一切，除了那3200万的投入，都归为伯克希尔所有（或者在早期来说，归为蓝筹印花）。在支付企业所得税以后，我们将这些收益用作收购其他企业的资金。**就像亚当和夏娃开创了产生60亿人类的事业一般，喜诗为伯克希尔提供了一系列的资金。（我们非常重视圣经中的那句“生养众多”）**

Last year See’s sales were $383 million, and pre-tax profits were $82 million. The capital now required to run the business is $40 million. This means we have had to reinvest only $32 million since 1972 to handle the modest physical growth – and somewhat immodest financial growth – of the business. In the meantime pre-tax earnings have totaled $1.35 billion. All of that, except for the $32 million, has been sent to Berkshire (or, in the early years, to Blue Chip). After paying corporate taxes on the profits, we have used the rest to buy other attractive businesses. Just as Adam and Eve kick-started an activity that led to six billion humans, See’s has given birth to multiple new streams of cash for us. (The biblical command to “be fruitful and multiply” is one we take seriously at Berkshire.)

<br>

像喜诗糖果这样的美国公司并不多。一般来说，一家公司如果从利润500万的公司发展到8200万需要大约4亿的资本投入。这是因为增长阶段的公司需要和销量相对应的经营资本，以及相关的固定资产投资。

There aren’t many See’s in Corporate America. Typically, companies that increase their earnings from $5 million to $82 million require, say, $400 million or so of capital investment to finance their growth. That’s because growing businesses have both working capital needs that increase in proportion to sales growth and significant requirements for fixed asset investments.

<br>

一个需要大幅增加资本投入来进行增长的公司可以被认为是理想的投资。在下一个例子中可以看到，从4亿有形净资产中获得每年8200万的税前收入并不是什么见不得人的事情。但是这样的模式对于喜诗糖果而言是截然不同的。**在几乎没有重大资本要求的情况下获得一个不断增长的现金流要终究是好得多。比如微软和谷歌。**

A company that needs large increases in capital to engender its growth may well prove to be a satisfactory investment. There is, to follow through on our example, nothing shabby about earning $82 million pre-tax on $400 million of net tangible assets. But that equation for the owner is vastly different from the See’s situation. It’s far better to have an ever-increasing stream of earnings with virtually no major capital requirements. Ask Microsoft or Google.

<br>

### 良好的商业模式 THE GOOD

一个良好的，但不至于激动人心的商业模式的例子就是我们的飞行安全培训公司。这个公司给客户提供的帮助能力和我所知道的其他任何公司能做到的一样好。它同时还具有着一个长久的竞争优势：去一个不是行业最优秀的飞行训练中心上课就像是出于省钱的目的而选择成功率更低的手术。

One example of good, but far from sensational, business economics is our own FlightSafety. This company delivers benefits to its customers that are the equal of those delivered by any business that I know of. It also possesses a durable competitive advantage: Going to any other flight-training provider than the best is like taking the low bid on a surgical procedure.

<br>

尽管如此，这样的商业模式需要大量的资本再投资来支持它的发展。当我们在1996收购飞行安全培训公司时，那一年的税前收益是1.11亿，固定资产的净投入是5.70亿。从我们收购的那一天开始算起，折旧累计的成本达到了9.23亿。但是资本资产共计是16.35亿，而这其中的大部分都用在了购买新机型相应的飞行模拟器上了。（每一个模拟器的价格都在1200万以上，而我们一共有273台模拟器。）我们的固定资产，除去折旧，现在达到了10.79亿。在2007年的税前经营收入是2.70亿，相对于1996年来说增长了1.59个亿。**基于我们至今投入的5.09亿资金而言，这样的增长给了我们良好的，但是远没有喜诗糖果般的收入。**

Nevertheless, this business requires a significant reinvestment of earnings if it is to grow. When we purchased FlightSafety in 1996, its pre-tax operating earnings were $111 million, and its net investment in fixed assets was $570 million. Since our purchase, depreciation charges have totaled $923 million. But capital expenditures have totaled $1.635 billion, most of that for simulators to match the new airplane models that are constantly being introduced. (A simulator can cost us more than $12 million, and we have 273 of them.) Our fixed assets, after depreciation, now amount to $1.079 billion. Pre-tax operating earnings in 2007 were $270 million, a gain of $159 million since 1996. That gain gave us a good, but far from See’s-like, return on our incremental investment of $509 million.

<br>

相应的，如果仅从经济利益出发，飞行安全培训公司使用的一个优秀的但不是杰出的商业模式。**它这样收入和支出呈正比的情况也是大多数企业面临的情况。**比如说，我们所拥有的大量公共事业方面投资统统都算作这个分类。我们在十年后会收获更多更多的收益，但这样的前提是我们需要额外的数十亿投资。

Consequently, if measured only by economic returns, FlightSafety is an excellent but not extraordinary business. Its put-up-more-to-earn-more experience is that faced by most corporations. For example, our large investment in regulated utilities falls squarely in this category. We will earn considerably more money in this business ten years from now, but we will invest many billions to make it.

<br>

### 糟糕的商业模式 THE GRUESOME

现在轮到糟糕的商业模式。最糟糕的商业模式是那些增长迅速，需要巨大资本维持增速，而最后几乎不赚钱的模式。航空公司就是一个例子。在这个行业，长久的竞争优势在莱特兄弟发明飞机的那天开始就没有存在过。**实际上，假使有那么一个富有远见资本家在莱特兄弟试飞的那天路过北卡罗来纳州的基蒂霍克县，那么他应该做的是立刻将弟弟威尔伯·莱特驾驶的飞机一枪打落，避免未来的资本家们络绎不绝的在航空行业烧钱。**

Now let’s move to the gruesome. The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or no money. Think airlines. Here a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.

<br>

航空行业自从莱特兄弟的第一次试飞后就处于供不应求的状态。受其行业增长率所吸引，投资者们不断地往这个无底洞倾泻资本。而值得我羞愧的是，我曾在1989年让伯克希尔参与过这样愚蠢的行为：买下全美航空的优先股。当我在支票上的签名笔迹尚未干透之前，公司的经营情况就开始俯冲而下。没过多久，全美航空就没有办法向我们持有的优先股支付股息。但是我们随后非常幸运。市场再一次突然对航空行业的前景感到乐观，哪怕实际上是只是假象。我们随后将我们持有的优先股以巨大的溢价卖出。在我们卖出以后的十年，全美航空还破产过两次。

The airline industry’s demand for capital ever since that first flight has been insatiable. Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it. And I, to my shame, participated in this foolishness when I had Berkshire buy U.S. Air preferred stock in 1989. As the ink was drying on our check, the company went into a tailspin, and before long our preferred dividend was no longer being paid. But we then got very lucky. In one of the recurrent, but always misguided, bursts of optimism for airlines, we were actually able to sell our shares in 1998 for a hefty gain. In the decade following our sale, the company went bankrupt. Twice.

<br>

**总体而言，你可以把这三种商业模式想象成三种类型的定期存款。**优秀的存款类型能为你带来丰厚的，逐年增长的利息。不错的那一类能给原有的资金和后来的存款带来不错的利息。糟糕的那一类不仅只支付微薄的利息，而且还要求你反复存钱。

To sum up, think of three types of “savings accounts.” The great one pays an extraordinarily high interest rate that will rise as the years pass. The good one pays an attractive rate of interest that will be earned also on deposits that are added. Finally, the gruesome account both pays an inadequate interest rate and requires you to keep adding money at those disappointing returns.

<br>

我现在是时候和大家坦白我过去犯下的错误了。需要注意的是在接下来我描述的几个错误里，没有咨询团队，董事会，或者券商的怂恿。用网球的术语说，这些错误属于非受迫性失误。

And now it’s confession time. It should be noted that no consultant, board of directors or investment banker pushed me into the mistakes I will describe. In tennis parlance, they were all unforced errors.

<br>

首先，我差点错过了喜诗糖果的收购机会。卖家的提出的价格是3000万，我当时坚定的说不会超过2500万。幸运的是，他妥协了。否则，考虑到当时我是不会妥协的，那13.5亿可能已经进了别人的口袋里。

To begin with, I almost blew the See’s purchase. The seller was asking $30 million, and I was adamant about not going above $25 million. Fortunately, he caved. Otherwise I would have balked, and that $1.35 billion would have gone to somebody else.

<br>

大概是刚好是收购喜诗糖果的那段时期，汤姆·墨菲，在未来是大都会广播公司的CEO，在那时和我打电话给我一份将全国广播公司在达拉斯-沃思堡分部以3500万卖给我的提议。该分部曾收购了沃思堡报纸，但是由于“跨所有制”规则墨菲不得不分拆。我当时知道电视广播站就像喜诗糖果的商业模式一样，几乎不需要资本投入，而且有着出色的增长前景。经营他们的难度很低而且能为股东带来海量的收益。

About the time of the See’s purchase, Tom Murphy, then running Capital Cities Broadcasting, called and offered me the Dallas-Fort Worth NBC station for $35 million. The station came with the Fort Worth paper that Capital Cities was buying, and under the “cross-ownership” rules Murph had to divest it. I knew that TV stations were See’s-like businesses that required virtually no capital investment and had excellent prospects for growth. They were simple to run and showered cash on their owners.

<br>

更多的，墨菲，正如和我现在的关系一样，当时和我已经是好友。我敬重他杰出的管理能力和优秀人格。他对于电视广播经营的了解非常透彻。在他没有十足把握交易是对我有利的情况下是不会给我打电话的。**基本上相当于，墨菲在暗示我出手买下电视台。但是我拒绝了。**

Moreover, Murph, then as now, was a close friend, a man I admired as an extraordinary manager and outstanding human being. He knew the television business forward and backward and would not have called me unless he felt a purchase was certain to work. In effect Murph whispered “buy” into my ear. But I didn’t listen.

<br>

在2006年，电视台的税前收益是7300万。也就是说自从我拒绝那项提议以后算起一共产生了至少10亿的收益，而这其中几乎所有都是可以用于其他商业活动的流动资金。并且，其物业的价值现在大约有8亿美金了。为什么我会说“不”？**唯一的解释是我的大脑当时在放假，而且忘了提醒我。（我的行为就像是政客莫利·艾文斯曾说过的那样：“如果他的智商还会下降，那么你应该记得每天往他头上浇两次水。”）**

In 2006, the station earned $73 million pre-tax, bringing its total earnings since I turned down the deal to at least $1 billion – almost all available to its owner for other purposes. Moreover, the property now has a capital value of about $800 million. Why did I say “no”? The only explanation is that my brain had gone on vacation and forgot to notify me. (My behavior resembled that of a politician Molly Ivins once described: “If his I.Q. was any lower, you would have to water him twice a day.”)

<br>

最后，我还犯了一个更加严重的错误。那就是我对德克斯特的交易说“是”。1993年我以价值为4.33亿的伯克希尔股票（共计25203份A级股）收购德克斯特鞋业。我当时认为是持久的竞争优势在收购后的几年就随即消失。**但是这只是错误的开始：因为我使用了伯克希尔的股票，这项错误也因此产生了巨大的复利。这一做法对于伯克希尔的股东产生的损失不仅仅只是4亿了，而是35亿。**这相当于，我将一个现在价值是2200亿的优秀公司的1.6%股份卖给了一个并没有价值的公司。

Finally, I made an even worse mistake when I said “yes” to Dexter, a shoe business I bought in 1993 for $433 million in Berkshire stock (25,203 shares of A). What I had assessed as durable competitive advantage vanished within a few years. But that’s just the beginning: By using Berkshire stock, I compounded this error hugely. That move made the cost to Berkshire shareholders not $400 million, but rather $3.5 billion. In essence, I gave away 1.6% of a wonderful business – one now valued at $220 billion – to buy a worthless business.

<br>

至今为止，德克斯特是我最失败的交易。但是我还会在未来犯更多的错误。你甚至可以赌我会这么做。**巴比·贝尔的一首乡村歌曲中有一句很好地解释了人们为什么会在商业收购中犯错：“我从未和一个丑女人上床睡觉，但是我相信我有那么几次是在丑女人身边醒来的。”**

To date, Dexter is the worst deal that I’ve made. But I’ll make more mistakes in the future – you can bet on that. A line from Bobby Bare’s country song explains what too often happens with acquisitions: “I’ve never gone to bed with an ugly woman, but I’ve sure woke up with a few.”

奥马哈

Omaha

<br>

无论是美国境内还是海外，金融市场陷入一片混乱。更可怕的是，这次危机已经开始在动摇着整体经济，从原本的汨汨而流发展到喷薄而出。在近期的未来，就业问题将持续恶化，商业活动将持续减缓，报纸头条将持续惊骇。

THE financial world is a mess, both in the United States and abroad. Its problems, moreover, have been leaking into the general economy, and the leaks are now turning into a gusher. In the near term, unemployment will rise, business activity will falter and headlines will continue to be scary.

<br>

那么我呢，我一直在买入美股。我说的是我的个人账户，在此之前我持有的全部都是美国政府债券。（我这么说是没有包括伯克希尔哈撒韦的持股部分，这一部分是会在未来用于慈善。）如果股票的价格持续走低，我的非伯克希尔部分的投资将全部转为美国股票。

So ... I’ve been buying American stocks. This is my personal account I’m talking about, in which I previously owned nothing but United States government bonds. (This description leaves aside my Berkshire Hathaway holdings, which are all committed to philanthropy.) If prices keep looking attractive, my non-Berkshire net worth will soon be 100 percent in United States equities.

<br>

为什么？

Why?

<br>

我的行为来自一个简单的理由：在别人贪婪时恐惧，在别人恐惧时贪婪。而在现在几乎可以肯定的是，恐惧遍布了整个金融市场，甚至是熟练的投资者们都无法幸免。诚然，投资者是有理由去在意那些使用了高杠杆而又身处竞争环境的公司。但是对于美国长期经济发展前景的担忧是站不住脚的。美国公司将会出现收益欠佳的情况，而这是一直都会有的事。但是他们之中的绝大部分将会在未来的5，10，20年收入创新高。

A simple rule dictates my buying: Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. And most certainly, fear is now widespread, gripping even seasoned investors. To be sure, investors are right to be wary of highly leveraged entities or businesses in weak competitive positions. But fears regarding the long-term prosperity of the nation’s many sound companies make no sense. These businesses will indeed suffer earnings hiccups, as they always have. But most major companies will be setting new profit records 5, 10 and 20 years from now.

<br>

让我在此明确一点：我无法预测短期的股市趋势。我对股市未来一个月或者一年的动向毫无头绪。但是有一点将会发生的是，股市将会，并可能相当程度上的，在悲观情绪消散或者经济情况好转之前会有良好表现。所以如果你想待到知更鸟回来之时，春季早已结束。

Let me be clear on one point: I can’t predict the short-term movements of the stock market. I haven’t the faintest idea as to whether stocks will be higher or lower a month — or a year — from now. What is likely, however, is that the market will move higher, perhaps substantially so, well before either sentiment or the economy turns up. So if you wait for the robins, spring will be over.

<br>

为大家回顾一下历史：大萧条时期，道琼斯指数在1932年7月8日抵达新低，41点。但是经济情况在富兰克林D.罗斯福在1933年3月上任之前依然在恶化。在那时，道琼斯已经上涨了30%。或者我们可以看看第二次世界大战的早期，也就是美国在欧洲和太平洋的战况不尽人意之时。股市在1942年4月触底，在那时盟军的命运的转折点还没有到来。同样的，20世纪80年代的早期，买入股票的时机恰好是通胀爆发而经济低迷的时期。简单来说，坏消息是投资者的好朋友。它能让你以折价买入美国未来的一小部分。

A little history here: During the Depression, the Dow hit its low, 41, on July 8, 1932. Economic conditions, though, kept deteriorating until Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in March 1933. By that time, the market had already advanced 30 percent. Or think back to the early days of World War II, when things were going badly for the United States in Europe and the Pacific. The market hit bottom in April 1942, well before Allied fortunes turned. Again, in the early 1980s, the time to buy stocks was when inflation raged and the economy was in the tank. In short, bad news is an investor’s best friend. It lets you buy a slice of America’s future at a marked-down price.

<br>

长期来看，股市的新闻将会带来好消息。20世纪，美国经历了两场世界大战以及一系列代价高昂损失惨重的军事冲突，大萧条，一次次金融危机和市场恐慌，油荒，流感疫情，一位蒙羞的总统的退位。然而道琼斯从66点直至11,497点。

Over the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.

<br>

你可能会认为一个投资者在如此有利的投资环境里面不可能出现损失。但是有些投资者却确实亏损了。那些不幸的人们在他们认为能够投资的时候才入市，在头条让他们惊慌的时候就卖出。

You might think it would have been impossible for an investor to lose money during a century marked by such an extraordinary gain. But some investors did. The hapless ones bought stocks only when they felt comfort in doing so and then proceeded to sell when the headlines made them queasy.

<br>

今天那些选择持有现金的人们会觉得安稳。而这并不应该。他们选择了一个长期来看并不如意的资产，几乎不带来收益而且迟早会贬值。更何况，政府面对缓解经融危机的一系列政策将会促进通货膨胀，也将会导致这些资产的加速贬值。

Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn’t. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value. Indeed, the policies that government will follow in its efforts to alleviate the current crisis will probably prove inflationary and therefore accelerate declines in the real value of cash accounts.

<br>

权益投资的收益在未来十年几乎肯定会超过现金类资产，可能差距还会很大。这些持有现金的投资者的假设是他们能够找准合适的时间迅速转变投资类型。不过他们在等待好消息的过程中，忽略了韦恩格雷茨基的建议：“我瞄准冰球将会抵达的位置，而不是它目前的方位。”

Equities will almost certainly outperform cash over the next decade, probably by a substantial degree. Those investors who cling now to cash are betting they can efficiently time their move away from it later. In waiting for the comfort of good news, they are ignoring Wayne Gretzky’s advice: “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.”

<br>

我不喜欢公开谈论股市的观点，我也需要再次强调我对股市未来短期的东西一无所知。尽管如此，我听从那一家在倒闭的银行里开张的餐馆的广告：“心动不如行动。”今天我的内心和我的步伐都向着股市。

I don’t like to opine on the stock market, and again I emphasize that I have no idea what the market will do in the short term. Nevertheless, I’ll follow the lead of a restaurant that opened in an empty bank building and then advertised: “Put your mouth where your money was.” Today my money and my mouth both say equities.

</p>

<br>

奥马哈

Omaha

<br>

我们的领导人要求“共同牺牲”。但是当他们真的这么做的时候，他们没有找我。我问了我的超级富有的朋友，他们的生活发生了什么变化。他们说没有受到任何影响。

OUR leaders have asked for “shared sacrifice.” But when they did the asking, they spared me. I checked with my mega-rich friends to learn what pain they were expecting. They, too, were left untouched.

<br>

当穷人和中产阶级在阿富汗为我们而战，当大多数美国人努力维持生计时，我们这些超级富豪继续享受我们非凡的税收优惠。我们中的一些人是投资经理，每天的劳动收入高达数十亿美元，但却被允许将我们的收入归类为“承担利益”，从而享受15%的优惠税率。还有一些人持有10分钟的股指期货，他们60%的收益按15%的税率征税，就好像他们是长期投资者一样。

While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks. Some of us are investment managers who earn billions from our daily labors but are allowed to classify our income as “carried interest,” thereby getting a bargain 15 percent tax rate. Others own stock index futures for 10 minutes and have 60 percent of their gain taxed at 15 percent, as if they’d been long-term investors.

<br>

这些和其他的恩惠都是由华盛顿的立法者们赐予我们的，他们觉得有必要保护我们，就好像我们是斑点猫头鹰或者其他什么濒危物种一样。有高位的朋友真好。

These and other blessings are showered upon us by legislators in Washington who feel compelled to protect us, much as if we were spotted owls or some other endangered species. It’s nice to have friends in high places.

<br>

去年我缴纳的联邦税款——包括我自己支付的所得税和代我支付的工资税——是6,938,744美元。这听起来是一大笔钱。但我所缴纳的只占我的应纳税收入的17.4%，而且这实际上是我们办公室里其他20个人中缴纳的百分比最低的。他们的税负从33%到41%，平均为36%。

Last year my federal tax bill — the income tax I paid, as well as payroll taxes paid by me and on my behalf — was $6,938,744. That sounds like a lot of money. But what I paid was only 17.4 percent of my taxable income — and that’s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office. Their tax burdens ranged from 33 percent to 41 percent and averaged 36 percent.

<br>

如果你是用钱赚钱，就像我的一些超级富有的朋友们那样，你的税率可能比我的低一点。但是如果你是靠工作赚钱，你的税率肯定会超过我的——很可能超过很多。

If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine — most likely by a lot.

<br>

要理解为什么，你需要考察政府收入的来源。去年，这些收入中大约80%来自个人所得税和工资税。超级富豪们大部分收入的所得税率只有15%，但几乎不用交工资税。而中产阶级的情况则不同：他们通常处于15%和25%的所得税档，而且还要承担沉重的工资税。

To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.

<br>

回到20世纪80年代和90年代，富人的税率要高得多，而我的税率处于中等水平。根据我有时听到的一种理论，我应该大发脾气，拒绝投资，因为资本利得和股息的税率太高了。

Back in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack. According to a theory I sometimes hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends.

<br>

我没有拒绝，其他人也没有。我和投资者合作了60年，我还没有见过任何人——即使在1976-77年资本利得税率为39.9%的时候——因为潜在收益的税率而放弃一个明智的投资。人们投资是为了赚钱，潜在的税收从来没有吓跑过他们。对于那些认为更高的税率会伤害就业创造的人，我想指出，在1980年到2000年之间，净增加了近4000万个工作岗位。你知道从那以后发生了什么：更低的税率和更低的就业创造。

I didn’t refuse, nor did others. I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone — not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 — shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off. And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what’s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation.

<br>

自1992年以来，美国国税局（I.R.S.）根据报告最高收入的400名美国人的纳税申报单编制了数据。1992年，最高收入的400人的应纳税收入总额为169亿美元，他们在这笔收入上缴纳了29.2%的联邦税。2008年，最高收入的400人的应纳税收入总额飙升到909亿美元——平均每人达到惊人的2.274亿美元——但他们缴纳的税率却降至21.5%。

Since 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion — a staggering $227.4 million on average — but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent.

<br>

我在这里提到的税收只包括联邦所得税，但你可以肯定的是，对于这400人来说，任何工资税都与收入相比微不足道。事实上，2008年的400人中有88人没有报告任何工资，但他们每个人都报告了资本收益。我的一些同胞可能不喜欢工作，但他们都喜欢投资。（我可以理解。）

The taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest. (I can relate to that.)

<br>

我很了解许多超级富豪，他们大多数都是非常正派的人。他们热爱美国，感激这个国家给予他们的机会。许多人加入了“捐赠誓言”，承诺将他们的大部分财富用于慈善事业。大多数人也不介意被告知要多缴税，尤其是当他们的许多同胞真正遭受苦难时。

I know well many of the mega-rich and, by and large, they are very decent people. They love America and appreciate the opportunity this country has given them. Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldn’t mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering.

<br>

十二名国会议员将很快承担重新安排我们国家财政的重要工作。他们被指示制定一个计划，将10年的赤字至少减少1.5万亿美元。然而，至关重要的是，他们要做的远不止于此。美国人正在迅速失去对国会处理我们国家财政问题的能力的信心。只有立即、真实和非常实质性的行动才能防止这种怀疑变成绝望。这种感觉可以创造出自己的现实。

Twelve members of Congress will soon take on the crucial job of rearranging our country’s finances. They’ve been instructed to devise a plan that reduces the 10-year deficit by at least $1.5 trillion. It’s vital, however, that they achieve far more than that. Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our country’s fiscal problems. Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness. That feeling can create its own reality.

<br>

这12个人的首要任务是削减一些即使是富裕的美国也无法兑现的未来承诺。这里必须节省大量资金。然后，这12个人应该转向收入问题。我会保持99.7%的纳税人的税率不变，并继续当前对雇员缴纳的工资税的2个百分点的减免。这种减免有助于穷人和中产阶级，他们需要尽可能多的优惠。

Job one for the 12 is to pare down some future promises that even a rich America can’t fulfill. Big money must be saved here. The 12 should then turn to the issue of revenues. I would leave rates for 99.7 percent of taxpayers unchanged and continue the current 2-percentage-point reduction in the employee contribution to the payroll tax. This cut helps the poor and the middle class, who need every break they can get.

<br>

但是对于那些收入超过100万美元的人——2009年有236883个这样的家庭——我会立即提高超过100万美元的应纳税所得额的税率，当然，这包括股息和资本利得。而对于那些收入超过1000万美元的人——2009年有8274个——我建议再增加一点税率。

But for those making more than $1 million — there were 236,883 such households in 2009 — I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including, of course, dividends and capital gains. And for those who make $10 million or more — there were 8,274 in 2009 — I would suggest an additional increase in rate.

<br>

我和我的朋友们已经被一个偏好亿万富翁的国会娇惯了够久了。是时候让我们的政府认真对待共同的牺牲了。

My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. It’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.

*编者注：这篇文章是沃伦·巴菲特向兰德尔·莱恩讲述的，发表在即将出版的《福布斯生活》杂志四月刊的“我25岁时”系列中。This article, by Warren Buffett, as told to Randall Lane, appears in the upcoming April issue of ForbesLife magazine, as part of its "When I Was 25" series.*

作者：沃伦·巴菲特 By Warren Buffett

自从我读了他的书《聪明的投资者》后，本杰明·格雷厄姆就一直是我的偶像。我之所以想去哥伦比亚商学院，是因为他是那里的教授，而在我从哥伦比亚毕业后，回到奥马哈，开始卖证券时，我也没有忘记他。在1951年到1954年之间，我一直是个讨厌鬼，给他频繁地寄送证券建议。后来我收到了一封回信：“下次你来纽约的时候，来见我。”

Benjamin Graham had been my idol ever since I read his book The Intelligent Investor. I had wanted to go to Columbia Business School because he was a professor there, and after I got out of Columbia, returned to Omaha, and started selling securities, I didn’t forget about him. Between 1951 and 1954, I made a pest of myself, sending him frequent securities ideas. Then I got a letter back: “Next time you’re in New York, come and see me.”

<br>

于是我就去了，他给我在格雷厄姆-纽曼公司（Graham-Newman Corp.）提供了一份工作，这是他和杰里·纽曼（Jerry Newman）经营的公司。大家都说A.W.琼斯（A.W. Jones）开创了对冲基金行业，但实际上格雷厄姆-纽曼的姐妹合伙公司纽曼和格雷厄姆（Newman and Graham）是更早的一家基金。我和怀孕四个月的妻子苏西（Susie），还有我的女儿搬到了纽约的怀特普莱恩斯（White Plains）。每天早上，我乘火车到大中央车站（Grand Central），然后去上班。

So there I went, and he offered me a job at Graham-Newman Corp., which he ran with Jerry Newman. Everyone says that A.W. Jones started the hedge fund industry, but Graham-Newman’s sister partnership, Newman and Graham, was actually an earlier fund. I moved to White Plains, New York, with my wife, Susie, who was four months pregnant, and my daughter. Every morning, I got on a train to Grand Central and went to work.

<br>

这是一个短暂的职位：第二年，当我25岁的时候，格雷厄姆先生——那时我叫他这个名字——告诉我他要退休了。事实上，他不仅仅是告诉我：他给了我一个机会来取代他，让杰里的儿子米奇成为新的高级合伙人，而我成为新的初级合伙人。这是一个非常小的基金——600万或700万美元——但它是一个著名的基金。

It was a short-lived position: The next year, when I was 25, Mr. Graham—that’s what I called him then—gave me a heads-up that he was going to retire. Actually, he did more than that: He offered me the chance to replace him, with Jerry’s son Mickey as the new senior partner and me as the new junior partner. It was a very tiny fund—$6 million or $7 million—but it was a famous fund.

<br>

这是一个痛苦的决定。这是我进入我的英雄的鞋子的机会——我甚至给我的第一个儿子取名为霍华德·格雷厄姆·巴菲特。（霍华德是我父亲的名字。）但我也想回到奥马哈。我可能每天早上都在想着告诉格雷厄姆先生我要离开。但这很难做到。

This was a traumatic decision. Here was my chance to step into the shoes of my hero—I even named my first son Howard Graham Buffett. (Howard was for my father.) But I also wanted to come back to Omaha. I probably went to work for a month thinking every morning that I would tell Mr. Graham I was going to leave. But it was hard to do.

<br>

事情是这样的，当我从大学毕业时，我有9800美元，但到了1955年底，我就有了127000美元。我想，我会回到奥马哈，上一些大学课程，多读一些书——我打算退休！我估计我们一年可以生活在12000美元上，而且凭借我的127000美元的资产基础，我可以轻松地做到这一点。我告诉我的妻子，“复利保证了我会变得富有。”

The thing is, when I got out of college, I had $9,800, but by the end of 1955, I was up to $127,000. I thought, I’ll go back to Omaha, take some college classes, and read a lot—I was going to retire! I figured we could live on $12,000 a year, and off my $127,000 asset base, I could easily make that. I told my wife, “Compound interest guarantees I’m going to get rich.”

<br>

我的妻子和孩子们在我之前回到了奥马哈。我上了车，一路向西，查看了我感兴趣的投资公司。这是尽职调查。我在宾夕法尼亚州的哈兹尔顿停下来，拜访了杰多-高地煤炭公司。我参观了密歇根州的卡拉马祖炉灶和熔炉公司，它正在清算。我去看看他们的建筑长什么样，他们有什么要卖的。我去了俄亥俄州的特拉华，查看了格雷夫兄弟木桶公司。（现在谁还知道什么是木桶制造？）它的董事长会见了我。我没有预约；我只是顺便拜访。我发现人们总是愿意跟我交谈。所有这些人都帮助了我。

My wife and kids went back to Omaha just ahead of me. I got in the car, and on my way west checked out companies I was interested in investing in. It was due diligence. I stopped in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, to visit the Jeddo-Highland Coal Company. I visited the Kalamazoo Stove & Furnace Company in Michigan, which was being liquidated. I went to see what the building looked like, what they had for sale. I went to Delaware, Ohio, to check out Greif Bros. Cooperage. (Who knows anything about cooperage anymore?) Its chairman met with me. I didn’t have appointments; I would just drop in. I found that people always talked to me. All these people helped me.

<br>

在奥马哈，我租了一栋房子，地址是5202 Underwood，每月175美元。我告诉我的妻子，“我很乐意买一栋房子，但那就像一个木匠卖掉他的工具箱。”我不想用掉我的资本。

In Omaha, I rented a house at 5202 Underwood for $175 a month. I told my wife, “I’d be glad to buy a house, but that’s like a carpenter selling his toolkit.” I didn’t want to use up my capital.

<br>

我没有计划开始一个合伙企业，甚至没有工作。只要我能自己操作，我就没有什么担心。我当然不想再向别人卖证券了。但是纯粹是偶然的，有七个人，包括我的一些亲戚，对我说，“你以前卖过股票，我们想让你告诉我们该怎么处理我们的钱。”我回答说，“我不会再那样做了，但是我会像本和杰瑞那样组建一个合伙企业，如果你想加入我，你可以。”我的岳父，我的大学室友，他的母亲，我的姑姑爱丽丝，我的妹妹，我的姐夫，还有我的律师都签了字。我还有一百美元。这就是开始——完全是意外的。

I had no plans to start a partnership, or even have a job. I had no worries as long as I could operate on my own. I certainly did not want to sell securities to other people again. But by pure accident, seven people, including a few of my relatives, said to me, “You used to sell stocks, and we want you to tell us what to do with our money.” I replied, “I’m not going to do that again, but I’ll form a partnership like Ben and Jerry had, and if you want to join me, you can.” My father-in-law, my college roommate, his mother, my aunt Alice, my sister, my brother-in-law, and my lawyer all signed on. I also had my hundred dollars. That was the beginning—totally accidental.

<br>

当我组建那个合伙人关系时，我们七个人加上我——我有99%的把握是在奥马哈俱乐部吃的晚饭。我花了49美分买了一本账本，他们带来了他们的支票。在我拿他们的钱之前，我给了他们一张半张纸，我用碳纸复印了——我称之为基本规则。我说，“有两到四页的合伙人法律文件。不用担心那个。我会告诉你里面有什么，你不会有任何惊喜。

When I formed that partnership, we had dinner, the seven of them plus me—I’m 99 percent sure it was at the Omaha Club. I bought a ledger for 49 cents, and they brought their checks. Before I took their money, I gave them a half sheet of paper that I had made carbons of—something I called the ground rules. I said, “There are two or four pages of partnership legal documents. Don’t worry about that. I’ll tell you what’s in it, and you won’t get any surprises.

<br>

“但这些基本原则是我的理念。如果你和我心有灵犀，那就跟我走。如果你不是，我也理解。我不会告诉你我们拥有什么或者类似的东西。我想在我应该得到鲜花的时候得到鲜花，我想在我应该被扔软水果的时候被扔软水果。但是如果我下跌了5%，而市场下跌了15%，我不想被扔水果——我会认为我应该得到一束鲜花。”我们把一切都说清楚了，他们就给了我支票。

“But these ground rules are the philosophy. If you are in tune with me, then let’s go. If you aren’t, I understand. I’m not going to tell you what we own or anything like that. I want to get bouquets when I deserve bouquets, and I want to get soft fruit thrown at me when I deserve it. But I don’t want fruit thrown at me if I’m down 5 percent, and the market’s down 15 percent—I’m going to think I deserve a bouquet for that.” We made everything clear, and they gave me their checks.

<br>

我没有做任何推销，但是更多的支票开始从我不认识的人那里寄来。在纽约，格雷厄姆-纽曼公司正在清算。在佛蒙特州有一位大学校长，霍默·道奇，他曾经和格雷厄姆投资过，他问，“本，我应该怎么处理我的钱？”本说，“嗯，有个曾经给我工作过的小伙子……”于是道奇开车来到奥马哈，到了我租住的房子。我当时25岁，看起来像17岁，表现得像12岁。他说，“你在做什么？”我说，“这是我和我的家人在做的事情，我也会和你一样做。”

I did no solicitation, but more checks began coming from people I didn’t know. Back in New York, Graham-Newman was being liquidated. There was a college president up in Vermont, Homer Dodge, who had been invested with Graham, and he asked, “Ben, what should I do with my money?” Ben said, “Well, there’s this kid who used to work for me.…” So Dodge drove out to Omaha, to this rented house I lived in. I was 25, looked about 17, and acted like 12. He said, “What are you doing?” I said, “Here’s what I’m doing with my family, and I’ll do it with you.”

<br>

虽然我不知道，但25岁是一个转折点。我正在改变我的生活，建立了一个后来会变成相当大的合伙企业，叫做伯克希尔·哈撒韦。我并不害怕。我在做我喜欢的事情，而且我现在还在做。

Although I had no idea, age 25 was a turning point. I was changing my life, setting up something that would turn into a fairly good-size partnership called Berkshire Hathaway. I wasn’t scared. I was doing something I liked, and I’m still doing it.

<p class="small">时间：2014年02月27日</p>
<p class="small">来源：Berkshire Hathaway Letters to Shareholders, 2014</p>
<p class="small">原文标题：Berkshire — Past, Present and Future
</p>

<br>

## 在一开始 In the Beginning

1964年5月6日，那时由Seabury Stanton先生领导的伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司向其股东发送了一份通知，提议以每股11.375美元的价格回购225,000股股票。我原本预期会收到这样的通知；但价格让我有些意外。

On May 6, 1964, Berkshire Hathaway, then run by a man named Seabury Stanton, sent a letter to its shareholders offering to buy 225,000 shares of its stock for $11.375 per share. I had expected the letter; I was surprised by the price.

<br>

伯克希尔当时有1,583,680股未流通股份。其中大约7%由我管理并投资了几乎所有净资产的巴菲特合伙有限公司（“BPL”）所持有。在要约信发出不久前，Stanton曾询问我BPL打算以什么价格出售其持股。我回答说11.50美元，他回应：“好的，我们达成协议了。”但随后伯克希尔的来信却降低了价格至少了八分之一点。这让我对Stanton的行为感到不满，因此我没有响应此要约。

Berkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett Partnership Ltd. (“BPL”), an investing entity that I managed and in which I had virtually all of my net worth. Shortly before the tender offer was mailed, Stanton had asked me at what price BPL would sell its holdings. I answered $11.50, and he said, “Fine, we have a deal.” Then came Berkshire’s letter, offering an eighth of a point less. I bristled at Stanton’s behavior and didn’t tender.

<br>

那实际上是一个非常糟糕的决定。

That was a monumentally stupid decision.

<br>

那时的伯克希尔是一家处于困境的北方纺织制造商。它所在的行业不仅名义上，而且实际上也在衰退中。而伯克希尔因为各种原因，未能及时调整方向。

Berkshire was then a northern textile manufacturer mired in a terrible business. The industry in which it operated was heading south, both metaphorically and physically. And Berkshire, for a variety of reasons, was unable to change course.

<br>

尽管这个行业的问题早已为人们所熟知，但情况仍然如此。1954年7月29日，伯克希尔的董事会记录清楚地列出了严酷的事实：“新英格兰的纺织业从四十年前就开始衰退。战争年代这一趋势得到了暂停。但这种趋势必须持续，直到供需达到平衡。”

That was true even though the industry’s problems had long been widely understood. Berkshire’s own Board minutes of July 29, 1954, laid out the grim facts: “The textile industry in New England started going out of business forty years ago. During the war years this trend was stopped. The trend must continue until supply and demand have been balanced.”

<br>

大约一年后的那次董事会后，拥有19世纪根基的伯克希尔精纺联合和哈撒韦制造公司携手合作，采用了我们今天的名字。凭借其十四家工厂和1万名员工，新合并的公司成为了新英格兰纺织业的巨擘。然而，两家公司的高层原本看做是合并协议的，很快就变成了灾难性的联盟。在合并后的七年里，伯克希尔一直处于整体亏损状态，其净资产缩水了37%。

About a year after that board meeting, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing — both with roots in the 19th Century — joined forces, taking the name we bear today. With its fourteen plants and 10,000 employees, the merged company became the giant of New England textiles. What the two managements viewed as a merger agreement, however, soon morphed into a suicide pact. During the seven years following the consolidation, Berkshire operated at an overall loss, and its net worth shrunk by 37%.

<br>

同时，该公司关闭了九家工厂，有时用清算所得来回购股份。这种情况引起了我的注意。

Meanwhile, the company closed nine plants, sometimes using the liquidation proceeds to repurchase shares. And that pattern caught my attention.

<br>

1962年12月，我购买了BPL的首批伯克希尔股票，预期还会有更多的关闭和回购。当时股票的售价只有7.50美元，远低于每股10.25美元的营运资本和20.20美元的账面价值。买这股票就像捡到一个被丢弃的雪茄烟蒂，上面还留有一口可以吸的烟。虽然烟蒂看起来破烂不堪、湿漉漉的，但那一口却是免费的。然而，一旦享受了那一刹那的愉悦，就别再期待更多了。

I purchased BPL’s first shares of Berkshire in December 1962, anticipating more closings and more repurchases. The stock was then selling for $7.50, a wide discount from per-share working capital of $10.25 and book value of $20.20. Buying the stock at that price was like picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puff remaining in it. Though the stub might be ugly and soggy, the puff would be free. Once that momentary pleasure was enjoyed, however, no more could be expected.

<br>

从那时起，伯克希尔紧紧地遵循了原定的脚本：很快又关闭了两家工厂，并在1964年5月用关闭的收益来回购股份。斯坦顿提供的价格比我们最初购买的成本高出50%。那它就在那里 —— 我那免费的一口气，就这样静静地等待着我，此后我可以在其他地方找寻更多被抛弃的烟蒂。

Berkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964 move, set out to repurchase shares with the shutdown proceeds. The price that Stanton offered was 50% above the cost of our original purchases. There it was — my free puff, just waiting for me, after which I could look elsewhere for other discarded butts.

<br>

然而，被斯坦顿的小气激怒后，我放弃了他的报价，开始大举购买更多的伯克希尔股份。

Instead, irritated by Stanton’s chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshire shares.

<br>

到1965年4月，BPL拥有392,633股（那时共有1,017,547股流通在外），而在五月初的董事会我们正式掌控了这家公司。通过西伯里和我那幼稚的行为 —— 毕竟，对我们两人来说这一点点分歧有什么大不了的呢？ —— 他失去了他的职位，我却发现自己将超过25%的BPL资本投资在一个我几乎一无所知的糟糕行业中。我仿佛成了那只追上了车的狗，却不知所措。

By April 1965, BPL owned 392,633 shares (out of 1,017,547 then outstanding) and at an early-May board meeting we formally took control of the company. Through Seabury’s and my childish behavior — after all, what was an eighth of a point to either of us? — he lost his job, and I found myself with more than 25% of BPL’s capital invested in a terrible business about which I knew very little. I became the dog who caught the car.

<br>

由于伯克希尔的运营损失和股票回购，到1964财年末其净值从1955年合并时的5500万美元降至2200万美元。这整整2200万美元都被纺织业务所占用：公司现金告罄，并且欠银行250万美元。（伯克希尔1964年的年度报告已在第130-142页上复制。）

Because of Berkshire’s operating losses and share repurchases, its net worth at the end of fiscal 1964 had fallen to $22 million from $55 million at the time of the 1955 merger. The full $22 million was required by the textile operation: The company had no excess cash and owed its bank $2.5 million. (Berkshire’s 1964 annual report is reproduced on pages 130-142.)

<br>

有段时间我算是走运了：伯克希尔立刻享受了两年的良好运营环境。更为幸运的是，在那几年里我们不需要缴纳所得税，因为我们有大量的亏损可以结转，这是前几年糟糕表现的结果。

For a time I got lucky: Berkshire immediately enjoyed two years of good operating conditions. Better yet, its earnings in those years were free of income tax because it possessed a large loss carry-forward that had arisen from the disastrous results in earlier years.

<br>

然而好景不长。自1966年起的18年里，我们持续不断地与纺织业务进行斗争，但都无济于事。但固执——或者说愚蠢？——也是有限度的。到了1985年，我终于认输了，并关闭了该业务。

Then the honeymoon ended. During the 18 years following 1966, we struggled unremittingly with the textile business, all to no avail. But stubbornness — stupidity? — has its limits. In 1985, I finally threw in the towel and closed the operation.

************

<br>

不受我首次将BPL的大部分资源投入到一个即将消亡的业务的错误影响，我迅速加剧了这个错误。确实，我的第二次错误比第一次更为严重，最终成为我职业生涯中代价最高的失误。

Undeterred by my first mistake of committing much of BPL’s resources to a dying business, I quickly compounded the error. Indeed, my second blunder was far more serious than the first, eventually becoming the most costly in my career.

<br>

在1967年初，我指示伯克希尔花费860万美元购买了国家赔偿公司（“NICO”），这是一家规模不大但颇具潜力的奥马哈基础保险公司。（交易还包括了一个小型的姊妹公司。）保险业是我的舒适区：我深刻理解并热衷于这个行业。

Early in 1967, I had Berkshire pay $8.6 million to buy National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a small but promising Omaha-based insurer. (A tiny sister company was also included in the deal.) Insurance was in my sweet spot: I understood and liked the industry.

<br>

Jack Ringwalt是NICO的老板，也是我的多年朋友，他想卖给我——确切的说，卖给我个人。他从没有打算把它卖给伯克希尔。那么，我为何选择用伯克希尔而非BPL来购买NICO呢？对于这个问题，我已经思考了48年，但仍然没有一个合理的答案。我只是犯了一个巨大的错误。

Jack Ringwalt, the owner of NICO, was a long-time friend who wanted to sell to me — me, personally. In no way was his offer intended for Berkshire. So why did I purchase NICO for Berkshire rather than for BPL? I’ve had 48 years to think about that question, and I’ve yet to come up with a good answer. I simply made a colossal mistake.

<br>

如果BPL是购买方，我和我的合伙人本可以完全拥有一家优秀的企业，它本应是构建伯克希尔成为今天这样规模的基石。更进一步，我们的成长不会被纺织业务中那些未产生效益的资金所拖累将近二十年。最终，我们随后的收购将完全由我和我的合伙人所拥有，而不是被伯克希尔的原股东所持有39%，我们并不对他们承担任何义务。尽管这些明显的事实就在我面前，我还是选择了将一个优良业务（NICO）的全部和一个糟糕业务（伯克希尔哈撒韦）的61%结合，这一决定最终导致大约1万亿美元从BPL的合伙人转移到了一群陌生人手中。

If BPL had been the purchaser, my partners and I would have owned 100% of a fine business, destined to form the base for building the company Berkshire has become. Moreover, our growth would not have been impeded for nearly two decades by the unproductive funds imprisoned in the textile operation. Finally, our subsequent acquisitions would have been owned in their entirety by my partners and me rather than being 39%-owned by the legacy shareholders of Berkshire, to whom we had no obligation. Despite these facts staring me in the face, I opted to marry 100% of an excellent business (NICO) to a 61%-owned terrible business (Berkshire Hathaway), a decision that eventually diverted $100 billion or so from BPL partners to a collection of strangers.

************

<br>

再多坦白一件事然后我将转向更加愉快的话题：你能相信在1975年我竟然购买了Waumbec Mills，另一家新英格兰的纺织公司吗？当然，从我们收到的资产和与伯克希尔原有纺织业务预期的协同效应来看，购买价格确实是个“便宜货”。但是——你猜怎么着——Waumbec成为了一个灾难，没过几年，这家工厂就被迫关闭了。

One more confession and then I’ll go on to more pleasant topics: Can you believe that in 1975 I bought Waumbec Mills, another New England textile company? Of course, the purchase price was a “bargain” based on the assets we received and the projected synergies with Berkshire’s existing textile business. Nevertheless — surprise, surprise — Waumbec was a disaster, with the mill having to be closed down not many years later.

<br>

现在来报告些好消息：北部的纺织行业终于消失了。如果你听说我被看到在新英格兰徘徊，你就不必再惊慌了。

And now some good news: The northern textile industry is finally extinct. You need no longer panic if you hear that I’ve been spotted wandering around New England.

## 查理给我指明方向 Charlie Straightens Me Out

当我管理着微薄资金时，我的“雪茄蒂”投资策略表现得非常出色。实际上，上世纪五十年代，我获得了许多免费的机会，这使得那个十年成为了我绝对和相对投资表现最佳的时期。

My cigar-butt strategy worked very well while I was managing small sums. Indeed, the many dozens of free puffs I obtained in the 1950s made that decade by far the best of my life for both relative and absolute investment performance.

<br>

然而，即便在那个时候，我也有一些例外，其中最重要的就是GEICO。多亏了我在1951年与洛里默·戴维森（Lorimer Davidson）进行的一次交谈。这位后来成为该公司首席执行官的出色人才让我了解到，GEICO是一家了不起的企业，于是我立刻将我的净资产的65%投入到了它的股票中。然而，那些早期年份的大部分收益都来自于那些以低价交易的中等水平公司的投资。本·格雷厄姆（Ben Graham）教给了我这一技巧，而它确实有效。

Even then, however, I made a few exceptions to cigar butts, the most important being GEICO. Thanks to a 1951 conversation I had with Lorimer Davidson, a wonderful man who later became CEO of the company, I learned that GEICO was a terrific business and promptly put 65% of my $9,800 net worth into its shares. Most of my gains in those early years, though, came from investments in mediocre companies that traded at bargain prices. Ben Graham had taught me that technique, and it worked.

<br>

然而，这种策略的一个主要弱点逐渐显现出来：雪茄蒂投资策略只在某个程度上可扩展。对于大笔资金，这种策略将永远无法表现良好。

But a major weakness in this approach gradually became apparent: Cigar-butt investing was scalable only to a point. With large sums, it would never work well.

<br>

此外，尽管以低价购买的边际企业可能在短期内吸引人，但它们不是建立一个大而持久企业的正确基础。选择结婚伙伴明显需要比约会更为严格的标准。（值得注意的是，伯克希尔哈撒韦（Berkshire Hathaway）可能是一个非常理想的“约会对象”：如果我们接受了西伯利·斯坦顿（Seabury Stanton）以11.375美元的价格购买我们的股份的提议，那么伯克希尔哈撒韦对其投资的年化加权回报率将达到约40%。）

In addition, though marginal businesses purchased at cheap prices may be attractive as short-term investments, they are the wrong foundation on which to build a large and enduring enterprise. Selecting a marriage partner clearly requires more demanding criteria than does dating. (Berkshire, it should be noted, would have been a highly satisfactory “date”: If we had taken Seabury Stanton’s $11.375 offer for our shares, BPL’s weighted annual return on its Berkshire investment would have been about 40%.)

<br>

需要查理·芒格才能打破我的雪茄蒂投资习惯，为建立一个规模庞大但获得令人满意利润的企业制定方向。查理就在我现在居住的地方几百英尺处长大，年轻时曾像我一样在我祖父的杂货店工作。然而，直到1959年，我才第一次见到查理，那时他已经离开奥马哈，定居洛杉矶。我当时28岁，而他35岁。介绍我们认识的奥马哈医生曾预言我们会合得来，事实证明他说得对。

It took Charlie Munger to break my cigar-butt habits and set the course for building a business that could combine huge size with satisfactory profits. Charlie had grown up a few hundred feet from where I now live and as a youth had worked, as did I, in my grandfather’s grocery store. Nevertheless, it was 1959 before I met Charlie, long after he had left Omaha to make Los Angeles his home. I was then 28 and he was 35. The Omaha doctor who introduced us predicted that we would hit it off — and we did.

<br>

如果你们参加过我们的年度股东大会，你们就知道查理拥有广泛的才智、惊人的记忆力，还有一些坚定的观点。我自己也不是个优柔寡断的人，我们有时候意见不合。然而，56年来，我们从未发生过争执。当我们有分歧时，查理通常会结束对话，说：“沃伦，好好考虑一下，你会同意我的，因为你很聪明，而我是正确的。”

If you’ve attended our annual meetings, you know Charlie has a wide-ranging brilliance, a prodigious memory, and some firm opinions. I’m not exactly wishy-washy myself, and we sometimes don’t agree. In 56 years, however, we’ve never had an argument. When we differ, Charlie usually ends the conversation by saying: “Warren, think it over and you’ll agree with me because you’re smart and I’m right.”

<br>

大多数人不知道的是，查理对建筑有着浓厚的兴趣。尽管他开始职业生涯是执业律师（计时费用为每小时15美元），但在30多岁时，查理通过设计和建造洛杉矶附近的五个公寓项目第一次赚到了真正的钱。与此同时，他设计了他今天住的房子，已经有55年了。（和我一样，如果他身处喜欢的环境中，查理也是不可动摇的。）近年来，查理还设计了斯坦福大学和密歇根大学的大型宿舍综合体，而现在，已经91岁的他正在进行另一个重大项目的设计。

What most of you do not know about Charlie is that architecture is among his passions. Though he began his career as a practicing lawyer (with his time billed at $15 per hour), Charlie made his first real money in his 30s by designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that he lives in today — some 55 years later. (Like me, Charlie can’t be budged if he is happy in his surroundings.) In recent years, Charlie has designed large dorm complexes at Stanford and the University of Michigan and today, at age 91, is working on another major project.

<br>

从我的角度来看，查理最重要的建筑壮举是设计今天的伯克希尔。他给我的蓝图很简单：忘记你知道的以美妙的价格购买普通企业的方式，取而代之的是，以公平的价格购买出色企业。

From my perspective, though, Charlie’s most important architectural feat was the design of today’s Berkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.

<br>

改变我的行为并非易事（问问我的家人就知道了）。在没有查理的建议之前，我已经取得了一些合理的成功，那么为什么要听一个从未在商学院待过一天的律师（咳咳，我则已经上了三个学期）呢？但查理从未厌倦地向我重复他关于商业和投资的格言，而他的逻辑是无可辩驳的。因此，伯克希尔是按照查理的蓝图建立起来的。我的角色就像总承包商，伯克希尔子公司的首席执行官才是实际工作的分包商。

Altering my behavior is not an easy task (ask my family). I had enjoyed reasonable success without Charlie’s input, so why should I listen to a lawyer who had never spent a day in business school (when — ahem — I had attended three). But Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and his logic was irrefutable. Consequently, Berkshire has been built to Charlie’s blueprint. My role has been that of general contractor, with the CEOs of Berkshire’s subsidiaries doing the real work as sub-contractors.

<br>

1972年对伯克希尔来说是一个转折点（尽管在我方面偶尔会有一些倒退，记得我在1975年购买Waumbec吗）。那时，我们有机会以蓝筹股票（Blue Chip Stamps）的名义购买See's Candy，这家公司是查理、我和伯克希尔都持有大量股份的公司，后来并入了伯克希尔。

The year 1972 was a turning point for Berkshire (though not without occasional backsliding on my part — remember my 1975 purchase of Waumbec). We had the opportunity then to buy See’s Candy for Blue Chip Stamps, a company in which Charlie, I and Berkshire had major stakes, and which was later merged into Berkshire.

<br>

See's是一家传奇的西海岸巧克力制造和零售商，当时每年实现税前约400万美元的利润，只利用了800万美元的净有形资产。此外，公司拥有一项在资产负债表上没有显示的巨大优势：广泛而持久的竞争优势，赋予了它重要的定价权。这种优势几乎可以肯定地使See's在未来的时间里获得重大的盈利。更好的是，这些盈利将只需进行少量增量投资就能实现。换句话说，See's可以预期未来几十年都会产生大量现金流。

See’s was a legendary West Coast manufacturer and retailer of boxed chocolates, then annually earning about $4 million pre-tax while utilizing only $8 million of net tangible assets. Moreover, the company had a huge asset that did not appear on its balance sheet: a broad and durable competitive advantage that gave it significant pricing power. That strength was virtually certain to give See’s major gains in earnings over time. Better yet, these would materialize with only minor amounts of incremental investment. In other words, See’s could be expected to gush cash for decades to come.

<br>

控制See's的家族希望以3000万美元出售该业务，查理说它值那么多是正确的。但我不想支付超过2500万美元，即使在那个数字上也不是特别热衷。（三倍净有形资产的价格让我感到有点吃惊。）我的谨慎可能会破坏一次绝佳的收购。但幸运的是，卖方决定接受我们2500万美元的报价。

The family controlling See’s wanted $30 million for the business, and Charlie rightly said it was worth that much. But I didn’t want to pay more than $25 million and wasn’t all that enthusiastic even at that figure. (A price that was three times net tangible assets made me gulp.) My misguided caution could have scuttled a terrific purchase. But, luckily, the sellers decided to take our $25 million bid.

<br>

至今，See's公司税前赚取了190亿美元，而这一增长仅需要额外投资4000万美元。西兹公司因此能够分配巨额资金，用以协助伯克希尔购并其他企业，这些企业进而创造了可观的可分配利润（可视为兔子的繁殖过程）。此外，透过观察西兹公司的运营，我获得了一份关于强大品牌价值的商业教育，这打开了我对许多其他有利可图投资的眼界。

To date, See’s has earned $1.9 billion pre-tax, with its growth having required added investment of only $40 million. See’s has thus been able to distribute huge sums that have helped Berkshire buy other businesses that, in turn, have themselves produced large distributable profits. (Envision rabbits breeding.) Additionally, through watching See’s in action, I gained a business education about the value of powerful brands that opened my eyes to many other profitable investments.

************

即便有了查理的蓝图，自Waumbec以来，我也犯了不少错误，其中最严重的是德克斯特鞋业。1993年我们收购了这家公司，当时它的业绩相当出色，绝不像一家“雪茄蒂”公司。然而，由于外国竞争的崛起，它的竞争优势迅速蒸发，而我却未能看到这一点。

Even with Charlie’s blueprint, I have made plenty of mistakes since Waumbec. The most gruesome was Dexter Shoe. When we purchased the company in 1993, it had a terrific record and in no way looked to me like a cigar butt. Its competitive strengths, however, were soon to evaporate because of foreign competition. And I simply didn’t see that coming.

<br>

因此，伯克希尔以43.3亿美元购得德克斯特，然而其价值很快便一落千丈。然而，根据通用会计准则，无法准确反映我的错误之重大。事实上，我向德克斯特的出售方提供了伯克希尔的股票，而我用于交易的股票现在价值约57亿美元。从财务灾难的角度看，这次错误堪称吉尼斯世界纪录的奇迹。

Consequently, Berkshire paid $433 million for Dexter and, rather promptly, its value went to zero. GAAP accounting, however, doesn’t come close to recording the magnitude of my error. The fact is that I gave Berkshire stock to the sellers of Dexter rather than cash, and the shares I used for the purchase are now worth about $5.7 billion. As a financial disaster, this one deserves a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.

<br>

我随后的一些错误也包括使用伯克希尔的股票购买那些注定无法实现增长的企业。这类错误是致命的。以一家卓越企业的股票 - 伯克希尔绝对属于此类企业 - 来换取一家普通企业的所有权将不可逆地损害价值。

Several of my subsequent errors also involved the use of Berkshire shares to purchase businesses whose earnings were destined to simply limp along. Mistakes of that kind are deadly. Trading shares of a wonderful business — which Berkshire most certainly is — for ownership of a so-so business irreparably destroys value.

<br>

在我们持有的公司犯下这种错误时，我们也遭受了财务损失（有时我还担任董事职务）。太多时候，CEO们似乎对一个基本的现实视而不见：在一项并购中，你用股票支付的内在价值不应该大于你获得的企业的内在价值。

We’ve also suffered financially when this mistake has been committed by companies whose shares Berkshire has owned (with the errors sometimes occurring while I was serving as a director). Too often CEOs seem blind to an elementary reality: The intrinsic value of the shares you give in an acquisition must not be greater than the intrinsic value of the business you receive.

<br>

我从未见过一位投资银行家在向潜在收购方董事会提出股权交易时量化这一极其重要的数学关系。相反，银行家的关注点往往在于描述当前用于并购的“惯例”市价溢价，这种评估并购吸引力的方式绝对是愚蠢的，或者交易是否将提高收购方的每股盈利（这本身不应该是决定性因素）。为了实现所需的每股数字，气喘吁吁的CEO和他的“助手”们经常会虚构出奇想的“协同效应”。（作为多年来19家公司的董事，我从未听说过“非协同效应”的提及，尽管我见证了交易完成后大量的这种情况。）美国董事会会议室中很少有对并购的事后总结，其中实际情况诚实地与最初的预测进行比较。它们应该成为标准做法。

I’ve yet to see an investment banker quantify this all-important math when he is presenting a stock-for-stock deal to the board of a potential acquirer. Instead, the banker’s focus will be on describing “customary” premiums-to-market-price that are currently being paid for acquisitions — an absolutely asinine way to evaluate the attractiveness of an acquisition — or whether the deal will increase the acquirer’s earnings-per-share (which in itself should be far from determinative). In striving to achieve the desired per-share number, a panting CEO and his “helpers” will often conjure up fanciful “synergies.” (As a director of 19 companies over the years, I’ve never heard “dis-synergies” mentioned, though I’ve witnessed plenty of these once deals have closed.) Post mortems of acquisitions, in which reality is honestly compared to the original projections, are rare in American boardrooms. They should instead be standard practice.

<br>

我向您保证，即使在我离开后的很长时间里，伯克希尔的CEO和董事会在发行股份进行任何收购之前都会仔细进行内在价值计算。即使您的顾问向您推荐了一份昂贵的“公允性”意见支持这种交易，您也不可能通过用一张百元钞票交换八张十元钞票而致富。

I can promise you that long after I’m gone, Berkshire’s CEO and Board will carefully make intrinsic value calculations before issuing shares in any acquisitions. You can’t get rich trading a hundred-dollar bill for eight tens (even if your advisor has handed you an expensive “fairness” opinion endorsing that swap).

************

<br>

总体而言，伯克希尔的收购表现得非常出色，尤其是在一些大规模收购案例中。同样，我们在可交易证券方面的投资也表现不俗。后者始终以其市场价格计值，因此任何收益，包括未实现的收益，都会立即反映在我们的净值中。但是，我们完全拥有的企业永远不会在我们的资产负债表上被重新升值，即使我们可以以数十亿美元以上的价格出售它们，高于其账面价值。伯克希尔子公司价值的未记录增长已经巨大，尤其在过去十年中增长迅猛。

Overall, Berkshire’s acquisitions have worked out well — and very well in the case of a few large ones. So, too, have our investments in marketable securities. The latter are always valued on our balance sheet at their market prices so any gains — including those unrealized — are immediately reflected in our net worth. But the businesses we buy outright are never revalued upward on our balance sheet, even when we could sell them for many billions of dollars more than their carrying value. The unrecorded gains in the value of Berkshire’s subsidiaries have become huge, with these growing at a particularly fast pace in the last decade.

<br>

倾听查理的建议确实带来了回报。

Listening to Charlie has paid off.

<br>

## 今日的伯克希尔Berkshire Today

如今，伯克希尔是一个庞大的企业集团，不断试图扩张更广泛。

Berkshire is now a sprawling conglomerate, constantly trying to sprawl further.

<br>

必须承认，企业集团在投资者中享有糟糕的声誉，而这一声誉是当之无愧的。首先，让我解释一下它们为何备受诟病，然后我将继续描述为何企业集团的形式为伯克希尔带来了巨大且长久的优势。

Conglomerates, it should be acknowledged, have a terrible reputation with investors. And they richly deserve it. Let me first explain why they are in the doghouse, and then I will go on to describe why the conglomerate form brings huge and enduring advantages to Berkshire.

<br>

自从我踏入商界以来，企业集团曾多次极为流行，其中最愚蠢的时期出现在20世纪60年代末。当时，企业集团的首席执行官们的做法很简单：通过个人魅力、推销手段，甚至可疑的会计方法（通常三者兼具），他们将新兴企业集团的股价推高至盈利的20倍左右，然后尽快发行股票，以收购其他盈利大约为10倍左右的企业。他们随后将“合并会计”这一术语应用于收购，尽管基础业务毫无改变，但这自动增加了每股盈利，他们以此作为管理天才的证明。接下来，他们向投资者解释，这种才能足以证明维持或甚至增强收购方的市盈率是正当的。最后，他们承诺将不断重复此程序，从而创造不断增长的每股盈利。

Since I entered the business world, conglomerates have enjoyed several periods of extreme popularity, the silliest of which occurred in the late 1960s. The drill for conglomerate CEOs then was simple: By personality, promotion or dubious accounting — and often by all three — these managers drove a fledgling conglomerate’s stock to, say, 20 times earnings and then issued shares as fast as possible to acquire another business selling at ten-or-so times earnings. They immediately applied “pooling” accounting to the acquisition, which — with not a dime’s worth of change in the underlying businesses — automatically increased per-share earnings, and used the rise as proof of managerial genius. They next explained to investors that this sort of talent justified the maintenance, or even the enhancement, of the acquirer’s p/e multiple. And, finally, they promised to endlessly repeat this procedure and thereby create ever-increasing per-share earnings.

<br>

华尔街对这种戏法的热爱在20世纪60年代愈演愈烈。华尔街的从业者总是愿意在可疑的手法用于捏造每股盈利上升时暂时抛开怀疑，尤其是如果这些高难度动作会产生巨额投行费用的并购交易的话。审计师们乐意为企业集团的会计工作洒下神圣的一抹水，有时甚至提出如何进一步榨取数字的建议。对许多人来说，容易赚取的丰厚利润淹没了道德底线。

Wall Street’s love affair with this hocus-pocus intensified as the 1960s rolled by. The Street’s denizens are always ready to suspend disbelief when dubious maneuvers are used to manufacture rising per-share earnings, particularly if these acrobatics produce mergers that generate huge fees for investment bankers. Auditors willingly sprinkled their holy water on the conglomerates’ accounting and sometimes even made suggestions as to how to further juice the numbers. For many, gushers of easy money washed away ethical sensitivities.

<br>

由于不断扩张的企业集团的每股盈利增长来自于利用市盈率差异，其首席执行官必须寻找那些以较低盈利倍数出售的企业。当然，这些企业通常都是前景平平的平庸企业。这种寻找低估股票的激励通常导致企业集团持有的基础企业变得越来越不值得投资。但这对投资者来说并不重要：他们主要看重的是交易速度和合并会计，以实现盈利的增长。

Since the per-share earnings gains of an expanding conglomerate came from exploiting p/e differences, its CEO had to search for businesses selling at low multiples of earnings. These, of course, were characteristically mediocre businesses with poor long-term prospects. This incentive to bottom-fish usually led to a conglomerate’s collection of underlying businesses becoming more and more junky. That mattered little to investors: It was deal velocity and pooling accounting they looked to for increased earnings.

<br>

由此带来的并购活动的火爆局面受到了媒体的追捧。像ITT、利顿工业、湾岸与西部以及LTV等公司备受推崇，它们的首席执行官成为名人。（这些曾经声名显赫的企业集团现在早已不复存在。正如约吉·贝拉所说，“每个拿破仑都会遭遇他的‘水门事件’。”）

The resulting firestorm of merger activity was fanned by an adoring press. Companies such as ITT, Litton Industries, Gulf & Western, and LTV were lionized, and their CEOs became celebrities. (These once-famous conglomerates are now long gone. As Yogi Berra said, “Every Napoleon meets his Watergate.”)

<br>

那个时候，各种各样的会计把戏——其中许多都毫无遮掩——被原谅或被忽视。事实上，在不断扩张的企业集团中，拥有一位会计巫师的领导被视为巨大的优势：在这些情况下，股东可以确信报告的盈利永远不会令人失望，无论业务的实际状况如何。

Back then, accounting shenanigans of all sorts — many of them ridiculously transparent — were excused or overlooked. Indeed, having an accounting wizard at the helm of an expanding conglomerate was viewed as a huge plus: Shareholders in those instances could be sure that reported earnings would never disappoint, no matter how bad the operating realities of the business might become.

<br>

20世纪60年代晚期，我参加了一次会议，一位热衷于并购的首席执行官吹嘘自己的“大胆、富有想象力的会计手法”。大多数聆听的分析师都表示认可，他们认为找到了一个无论业务结果如何都能实现预测的经理。

In the late 1960s, I attended a meeting at which an acquisitive CEO bragged of his “bold, imaginative accounting.” Most of the analysts listening responded with approving nods, seeing themselves as having found a manager whose forecasts were certain to be met, whatever the business results might be.

<br>

然而，最终钟声响起，一切都变成了南瓜和老鼠。再次变得明显的是，基于高价股票的连续发行的商业模式——就像连锁信模式一样——确实重新分配财富，但绝不创造财富。然而，这两种现象周期性地在我们的国家盛行——它们是每个推销员的梦想——尽管它们经常以精心策划的伪装出现。结局总是一样的：钱从轻信者流向欺诈者。而与连锁信不同，股票的金额被劫持可能会令人震惊。

Eventually, however, the clock struck twelve, and everything turned to pumpkins and mice. Once again, it became evident that business models based on the serial issuances of overpriced shares — just like chain-letter models — most assuredly redistribute wealth, but in no way create it. Both phenomena, nevertheless, periodically blossom in our country — they are every promoter’s dream — though often they appear in a carefully-crafted disguise. The ending is always the same: Money flows from the gullible to the fraudster. And with stocks, unlike chain letters, the sums hijacked can be staggering.

<br>

在BPL和伯克希尔，我们从未投资于那些执意发行股票的公司。这种行为往往是一个典型的推销型管理、脆弱的会计体系、高估值的股票，而且太常常还涉及到彻底的不诚实。

At both BPL and Berkshire, we have never invested in companies that are hell-bent on issuing shares. That behavior is one of the surest indicators of a promotion-minded management, weak accounting, a stock that is overpriced and — all too often — outright dishonesty.

************

<br>

那么，查理和我对伯克希尔的企业集团结构有什么吸引力呢？简单来说：如果企业集团形式得当，它是最大程度实现长期资本增长的理想结构之一。

So what do Charlie and I find so attractive about Berkshire’s conglomerate structure? To put the case simply: If the conglomerate form is used judiciously, it is an ideal structure for maximizing long-term capital growth.

<br>

资本主义的一大优点之一是它能够高效配置资金。论点是市场将资金引导到有前景的企业，拒绝流向注定衰败的企业。这是正确的：尽管市场存在过度之处，但市场驱动的资本配置通常比任何其他方式要好得多。

One of the heralded virtues of capitalism is that it efficiently allocates funds. The argument is that markets will direct investment to promising businesses and deny it to those destined to wither. That is true: With all its excesses, market-driven allocation of capital is usually far superior to any alternative.

<br>

然而，在纺织行业内，理性的资本撤回常常会受到障碍。正如那些1954年的伯克希尔会议记录所清楚显示的那样，本应该显而易见的纺织业内资本的撤回被因管理层的虚荣和自身利益而拖延了几十年。事实上，我自己对于放弃陈旧的纺织厂也拖延了太久。

Nevertheless, there are often obstacles to the rational movement of capital. As those 1954 Berkshire minutes made clear, capital withdrawals within the textile industry that should have been obvious were delayed for decades because of the vain hopes and self-interest of managements. Indeed, I myself delayed abandoning our obsolete textile mills for far too long.

<br>

资本已用于不断衰退业务的首席执行官很少会选择将大量资本重新投入无关的活动中。这种举措通常需要解雇长期的合作伙伴并承认错误。此外，即使他或她有意进行，也不太可能成为您希望处理重新配置工作的经理。

A CEO with capital employed in a declining operation seldom elects to massively redeploy that capital into unrelated activities. A move of that kind would usually require that long-time associates be fired and mistakes be admitted. Moreover, it’s unlikely that CEO would be the manager you would wish to handle the redeployment job even if he or she was inclined to undertake it.

<br>

在股东层面上，当个人投资者试图在业务和行业之间重新配置资本时，税收和摩擦成本会对他们产生重大影响。即使是免税的机构投资者在移动资本时也会面临重大成本，因为他们通常需要中介来完成这项工作。此时会有许多口味高昂的人争相获得满足，包括投资银行家、会计师、顾问、律师以及资本重新配置者等。金钱转移者并非便宜。

At the shareholder level, taxes and frictional costs weigh heavily on individual investors when they attempt to reallocate capital among businesses and industries. Even tax-free institutional investors face major costs as they move capital because they usually need intermediaries to do this job. A lot of mouths with expensive tastes then clamor to be fed — among them investment bankers, accountants, consultants, lawyers and such capital-reallocators as leveraged buyout operators. Money-shufflers don’t come cheap.

<br>

相比之下，像伯克希尔这样的企业集团完全有条件以合理的方式和最低的成本分配资本。当然，形式本身并不能保证成功：我们犯了很多错误，还会犯更多错误。然而，我们的结构性优势是强大的。

In contrast, a conglomerate such as Berkshire is perfectly positioned to allocate capital rationally and at minimal cost. Of course, form itself is no guarantee of success: We have made plenty of mistakes, and we will make more. Our structural advantages, however, are formidable.

在伯克希尔，我们可以在几乎没有税收或其他成本的情况下，将巨额资金从那些具有有限增长机会的业务领域转移到其他拥有更大潜力的领域。此外，我们不受终身与特定行业相联的历史偏见影响，也不受那些对维护现状有利益关系的同事的压力。这一点非常重要：如果马匹掌控着投资决策，汽车工业就不会存在。

At Berkshire, we can — without incurring taxes or much in the way of other costs — move huge sums from businesses that have limited opportunities for incremental investment to other sectors with greater promise. Moreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject to pressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. That’s important: If horses had controlled investment decisions, there would have been no auto industry.

<br>

我们拥有的另一个主要优势是能够购买优秀企业的一部分，也就是常规股票。这对于大多数管理层来说并不是一个可行的选择。在我们的历史中，这种战略选择已被证明非常有帮助；广泛的选择总是能够提高决策质量。股市每天向我们提供的企业，虽然只提供了一小部分，通常比我们同时被提供的整个企业更具吸引力。此外，我们从可交易证券中获得的收益帮助我们进行了一些大规模的收购，否则这些收购将超出我们的财务能力。

Another major advantage we possess is the ability to buy pieces of wonderful businesses — a.k.a. common stocks. That’s not a course of action open to most managements. Over our history, this strategic alternative has proved to be very helpful; a broad range of options always sharpens decision-making. The businesses we are offered by the stock market every day — in small pieces, to be sure — are often far more attractive than the businesses we are concurrently being offered in their entirety. Additionally, the gains we’ve realized from marketable securities have helped us make certain large acquisitions that would otherwise have been beyond our financial capabilities.

<br>

实际上，对于伯克希尔来说，世界是一个巨大的宝库——一个为我们提供比大多数公司更多机会的世界。当然，我们受到了一个限制，那就是我们只能评估我们能够理解的企业的经济前景。这是一个严重的限制：查理和我对许多公司十年后会变成什么样毫无头绪。但这个限制要比那些经验局限于单一行业的高管所受到的限制小得多。此外，我们能够以可观的规模扩大业务，远远超出了那些受制于单一行业有限潜力的许多企业。

In effect, the world is Berkshire’s oyster — a world offering us a range of opportunities far beyond those realistically open to most companies. We are limited, of course, to businesses whose economic prospects we can evaluate. And that’s a serious limitation: Charlie and I have no idea what a great many companies will look like ten years from now. But that limitation is much smaller than that borne by an executive whose experience has been confined to a single industry. On top of that, we can profitably scale to a far larger size than the many businesses that are constrained by the limited potential of the single industry in which they operate.

<br>

正如我之前提到的，西兹糖果相对较少的资本需求却创造了巨大的盈利。当然，我们本来希望能够聪明地利用这些资金来扩展我们的糖果业务。但是，我们多次尝试都基本无功而返。因此，无需产生税收低效或摩擦成本，我们已经利用西兹糖果产生的多余资金来帮助购买其他企业。如果西兹糖果保持了独立性，那么它的盈利将不得不分配给投资者以重新投资，有时在经过大额税收和几乎总是伴随着重大摩擦和代理成本的大幅削减之后。

I mentioned earlier that See’s Candy had produced huge earnings compared to its modest capital requirements. We would have loved, of course, to intelligently use those funds to expand our candy operation. But our many attempts to do so were largely futile. So, without incurring tax inefficiencies or frictional costs, we have used the excess funds generated by See’s to help purchase other businesses. If See’s had remained a stand-alone company, its earnings would have had to be distributed to investors to redeploy, sometimes after being heavily depleted by large taxes and, almost always, by significant frictional and agency costs.

************

<br>

伯克希尔还有一个优势，这一优势随着时间的推移变得愈发重要：我们现在是许多杰出企业的首选之地。

Berkshire has one further advantage that has become increasingly important over the years: We are now the home of choice for the owners and managers of many outstanding businesses.

<br>

拥有成功企业的家族在考虑出售时有多种选择。经常情况下，最好的决策是什么都不做。生活中还有比拥有一家繁荣企业，而且这家企业自己非常了解的更糟糕的事情。但坐而不动通常不是华尔街的建议。（不要问理发师是否需要理发。）

Families that own successful businesses have multiple options when they contemplate sale. Frequently, the best decision is to do nothing. There are worse things in life than having a prosperous business that one understands well. But sitting tight is seldom recommended by Wall Street. (Don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.)

<br>

当家族中的一部分希望出售而其他人希望继续时，公开发行通常是明智的选择。但是，当业主希望完全退出时，他们通常会考虑其中一种路径。

When one part of a family wishes to sell while others wish to continue, a public offering often makes sense. But, when owners wish to cash out entirely, they usually consider one of two paths.

<br>

卖家的第一选择是将企业卖给一个渴望能够从两家公司合并中获得“协同效应”而垂涎三尺的竞争对手。这类买家通常考虑摆脱掉卖方企业的大量员工，而这些员工正是协助企业主建立业务的可贵力量。然而，一个负责任的企业主——而且这样的企业主众多——通常不愿看到自己多年的同事沮丧地唱起那首老式乡村歌曲：“她得了金矿，我得到了矿井。”

The first is sale to a competitor who is salivating at the possibility of wringing “synergies” from the combining of the two companies. This buyer invariably contemplates getting rid of large numbers of the seller’s associates, the very people who have helped the owner build his business. A caring owner, however — and there are plenty of them — usually does not want to leave his long-time associates sadly singing the old country song: “She got the goldmine, I got the shaft.”

<br>

卖家的第二选择是选择华尔街买家。多年来，这些买家准确地称自己为“杠杆收购公司”。当这个词汇在1990年代初声名狼藉——还记得RJR和《大门上的野蛮人》吗？——这些买家急忙将自己改名为“私募股权公司”。

The second choice for sellers is the Wall Street buyer. For some years, these purchasers accurately called themselves “leveraged buyout firms.” When that term got a bad name in the early 1990s — remember RJR and Barbarians at the Gate? — these buyers hastily relabeled themselves “private-equity.”

<br>

名字或许改了，但那只是表面的变化：在几乎所有私募股权交易中，股权被大幅削减，而债务则累积起来。事实上，私募股权买家向卖家提供的金额部分取决于买家评估能够放在被收购公司身上的最大债务数额。

The name may have changed but that was all: Equity is dramatically reduced and debt is piled on in virtually all private-equity purchases. Indeed, the amount that a private-equity purchaser offers to the seller is in part determined by the buyer assessing the maximum amount of debt that can be placed on the acquired company.

<br>

随后，如果事情进展顺利，股权开始增加，杠杆收购公司通常会寻求通过新的借款再次加杠杆。然后，他们通常会使用部分收益支付巨额股息，将股权迅速压低，有时甚至变成负数。

Later, if things go well and equity begins to build, leveraged buy-out shops will often seek to re-leverage with new borrowings. They then typically use part of the proceeds to pay a huge dividend that drives equity sharply downward, sometimes even to a negative figure.

<br>

事实上，对于许多私募股权买家来说，“股权”是一个不太受欢迎的词汇；他们更喜欢债务。而且，由于债务目前如此廉价，这些买家通常可以付出最高价。随后，企业将经常被再次出售，通常是卖给另一家杠杆买家。实际上，企业变成了商品。

In truth, “equity” is a dirty word for many private-equity buyers; what they love is debt. And, because debt is currently so inexpensive, these buyers can frequently pay top dollar. Later, the business will be resold, often to another leveraged buyer. In effect, the business becomes a piece of merchandise.

<br>

对于那些希望出售的企业主来说，伯克希尔提供了第三种选择：一个永久的家，其中公司的人员和文化将被保留（尽管偶尔需要管理变更）。此外，我们所收购的任何企业都将大幅增强其财务实力和增长能力。它不再需要与银行和华尔街分析师打交道。

Berkshire offers a third choice to the business owner who wishes to sell: a permanent home, in which the company’s people and culture will be retained (though, occasionally, management changes will be needed). Beyond that, any business we acquire dramatically increases its financial strength and ability to grow. Its days of dealing with banks and Wall Street analysts are also forever ended.

<br>

有些卖家可能不关心这些事情。但是，当卖家关心时，伯克希尔并没有太多的竞争对手。

Some sellers don’t care about these matters. But, when sellers do, Berkshire does not have a lot of competition.

************

<br>

有时候，专家会建议伯克希尔公司将其某些业务分拆出去。这些建议毫无道理。我们的公司作为伯克希尔的一部分，价值更高，而不是独立实体。一个原因是我们有能力在业务之间或进入新的企业时，立即进行资金调动，而且无需支付税款。此外，如果业务被分开，某些成本可能会在全部或部分业务中重复产生。这里有一个最明显的例子：伯克希尔仅为其单一董事会支付名义成本；如果我们的数十个子公司被拆分出去，董事会的总成本将飙升。监管和行政开支也会同样增加。

Sometimes pundits propose that Berkshire spin-off certain of its businesses. These suggestions make no sense. Our companies are worth more as part of Berkshire than as separate entities. One reason is our ability to move funds between businesses or into new ventures instantly and without tax. In addition, certain costs duplicate themselves, in full or part, if operations are separated. Here’s the most obvious example: Berkshire incurs nominal costs for its single board of directors; were our dozens of subsidiaries to be split off, the overall cost for directors would soar. So, too, would regulatory and administration expenditures.

<br>

最后，由于我们拥有子公司B，因此子公司A有时会获得重要的税收效益。例如，我们的公用事业部门目前只能实现某些税收抵免，因为我们在伯克希尔的其他运营部门产生了巨额应税收入。这使得伯克希尔哈撒韦能源在开发风能和太阳能项目方面比大多数上市公用事业公司具有更大的优势。

Finally, there are sometimes important tax efficiencies for Subsidiary A because we own Subsidiary B. For example, certain tax credits that are available to our utilities are currently realizable only because we generate huge amounts of taxable income at other Berkshire operations. That gives Berkshire Hathaway Energy a major advantage over most public-utility companies in developing wind and solar projects.

<br>

投资银行家，由于他们的行动而得到报酬，不断敦促收购者为公开持有的企业支付市场价值的20%到50%的溢价。银行家告诉买方，这种溢价是为了“控制价值”和一旦收购者的CEO掌握公司后将发生的美好事情所合理化的。（哪位渴望收购的经理会质疑这一说法呢？）

Investment bankers, being paid as they are for action, constantly urge acquirers to pay 20% to 50% premiums over market price for publicly-held businesses. The bankers tell the buyer that the premium is justified for “control value” and for the wonderful things that are going to happen once the acquirer’s CEO takes charge. (What acquisition-hungry manager will challenge that assertion?)

<br>

几年后，银行家——一脸严肃地再次出现，一如既往地急切地建议剥离先前的收购，以“释放股东价值”。分拆，当然，会剥夺所属公司所谓的“控制价值”，而不提供任何补偿。银行家解释说，分拆后的公司将蓬勃发展，因为其管理层将更具企业家精神，摆脱了母公司沉闷的官僚主义。（那位才华横溢的CEO我们早先见过的事情就这么被抛在脑后了。）

A few years later, bankers — bearing straight faces — again appear and just as earnestly urge spinning off the earlier acquisition in order to “unlock shareholder value.” Spin-offs, of course, strip the owning company of its purported “control value” without any compensating payment. The bankers explain that the spun-off company will flourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracy of the parent company. (So much for that talented CEO we met earlier.)

<br>

如果剥离的公司后来希望重新收购被分拆的业务，毫无疑问，再次会被银行家敦促支付可观的“控制”溢价以获得这一特权。（银行界这种思维方式已经引发了人们说，费用太经常导致交易，而不是交易引发费用。）

If the divesting company later wishes to reacquire the spun-off operation, it presumably would again be urged by its bankers to pay a hefty “control” premium for the privilege. (Mental “flexibility” of this sort by the banking fraternity has prompted the saying that fees too often lead to transactions rather than transactions leading to fees.)

<br>

当然，伯克希尔未来可能会受到监管机构要求进行分拆或出售的可能性。1979年，伯克希尔就曾进行过这样的分拆，当时，新的银行控股公司监管规定迫使我们剥离了伊利诺伊州洛克福德的一家银行。

It’s possible, of course, that someday a spin-off or sale at Berkshire would be required by regulators. Berkshire carried out such a spin-off in 1979, when new regulations for bank holding companies forced us to divest a bank we owned in Rockford, Illinois.

<br>

然而，对我们来说，自愿性分拆毫无意义：我们将失去控制价值、资本分配的灵活性，以及在某些情况下，重要的税收优势。目前出色地管理着我们子公司的CEO，如果要管理分拆出去的业务，将会面临困难，因为他们得益于伯克希尔的所有权而拥有的运营和财务优势。此外，母公司和分拆出去的业务一旦分开，很可能会产生比它们合并时更高的适度成本。

Voluntary spin-offs, though, make no sense for us: We would lose control value, capital-allocation flexibility and, in some cases, important tax advantages. The CEOs who brilliantly run our subsidiaries now would have difficulty in being as effective if running a spun-off operation, given the operating and financial advantages derived from Berkshire’s ownership. Moreover, the parent and the spun-off operations, once separated, would likely incur moderately greater costs than existed when they were combined.

************

<br>

在我结束关于分拆的讨论之前，让我们从早前提到的一个混合企业中汲取一些教训：LTV。我会在这里做个简要总结，但那些喜欢精彩财经故事的人可以查看1982年10月份D Magazine上刊登的关于Jimmy Ling的文章。可以在互联网上找到这篇文章。

Before I depart the subject of spin-offs, let’s look at a lesson to be learned from a conglomerate mentioned earlier: LTV. I’ll summarize here, but those who enjoy a good financial story should read the piece about Jimmy Ling that ran in the October 1982 issue of D Magazine. Look it up on the Internet.

<br>

通过大量企业策略的精彩表演，Ling将LTV从1965年仅3600万美元的销售额提升到仅仅两年后的《财富》500强排名第14位。值得注意的是，Ling从未展示过任何管理技能。但查理很早以前告诉我，永远不要低估那些高估自己的人。在这一点上，Ling没有对手。

Through a lot of corporate razzle-dazzle, Ling had taken LTV from sales of only $36 million in 1965 to number 14 on the Fortune 500 list just two years later. Ling, it should be noted, had never displayed any managerial skills. But Charlie told me long ago to never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. And Ling had no peer in that respect.

<br>

林的策略，他称之为“项目重组”，是购买一家大公司，然后部分分拆其各个部门。在LTV的1966年年报中，他解释了随之而来的魔法：“最重要的是，收购必须符合2加2等于5（或6）的测试公式。”媒体、公众和华尔街都喜欢这种说法。

Ling’s strategy, which he labeled “project redeployment,” was to buy a large company and then partially spin off its various divisions. In LTV’s 1966 annual report, he explained the magic that would follow: “Most importantly, acquisitions must meet the test of the 2 plus 2 equals 5 (or 6) formula.” The press, the public and Wall Street loved this sort of talk.

<br>

1967年，林购买了威尔森公司（Wilson & Co.），这是一家巨大的肉类加工公司，还涉足高尔夫装备和制药业。不久之后，他将母公司分拆为三个业务，威尔森公司（肉类加工），威尔森体育用品和威尔森制药公司，每个业务都将部分分拆。这些公司很快在华尔街被称为肉丸（Meatball），高尔夫球（Golf Ball）和傻瓜球（Goof Ball）。

In 1967 Ling bought Wilson & Co., a huge meatpacker that also had interests in golf equipment and pharmaceuticals. Soon after, he split the parent into three businesses, Wilson & Co. (meatpacking), Wilson Sporting Goods and Wilson Pharmaceuticals, each of which was to be partially spun off. These companies quickly became known on Wall Street as Meatball, Golf Ball and Goof Ball.

<br>

然而，不久之后，就像伊卡洛斯一样，林飞得太靠近太阳，问题开始显现。到了20世纪70年代初，林的帝国开始溃败，而他本人也被从LTV中“分拆”出去……也就是被解雇了。

Soon thereafter, it became clear that, like Icarus, Ling had flown too close to the sun. By the early 1970s, Ling’s empire was melting, and he himself had been spun off from LTV . . . that is, fired.

<br>

定期地，金融市场会脱离现实——可以肯定会发生这种情况。会出现更多的吉米·林（Jimmy Ling）。他们看起来和听起来都很有权威。媒体会追随他们的每个言论。银行家们会争夺他们的业务。他们所说的话最近都“奏效了”。他们的早期追随者会感到非常聪明。我们的建议是：不管他们怎么说，永远不要忘记2加2始终等于4。当有人告诉你这种数学已经过时时——扣紧你的钱包，度个假，几年后以便以便宜的价格购买股票回来。

Periodically, financial markets will become divorced from reality — you can count on that. More Jimmy Lings will appear. They will look and sound authoritative. The press will hang on their every word. Bankers will fight for their business. What they are saying will recently have “worked.” Their early followers will be feeling very clever. Our suggestion: Whatever their line, never forget that 2+2 will always equal 4. And when someone tells you how old-fashioned that math is ---zip up your wallet, take a vacation and come back in a few years to buy stocks at cheap prices.

<br>

今天，伯克希尔拥有以下强大优势：（1）无与伦比的企业组合，其中大多数现在享有良好的经济前景；（2）一支杰出的管理团队，几乎没有例外，他们对自己经营的子公司和伯克希尔都非常忠诚；（3）非同寻常的收益多样性、卓越的财务实力和充沛的流动性，在任何情况下我们都将保持；（4）在许多正在考虑出售他们的企业的业主和经理中，我们排名第一选择；以及（5）与前一项相关的一点，一种与大多数大公司在许多方面都截然不同的文化，这是我们花费了50年时间来培养的，现在已经牢不可破。

Today Berkshire possesses (1) an unmatched collection of businesses, most of them now enjoying favorable economic prospects; (2) a cadre of outstanding managers who, with few exceptions, are unusually devoted to both the subsidiary they operate and to Berkshire; (3) an extraordinary diversity of earnings, premier financial strength and oceans of liquidity that we will maintain under all circumstances; (4) a first-choice ranking among many owners and managers who are contemplating sale of their businesses and (5) in a point related to the preceding item, a culture, distinctive in many ways from that of most large companies, that we have worked 50 years to develop and that is now rock-solid.

<br>

这些优势为我们提供了一个出色的基础，可以在其上继续发展。

These strengths provide us a wonderful foundation on which to build.

<br>

## 伯克希尔未来50年 The Next 50 Years at Berkshire

接下来，让我们来看看未来的道路。请记住，如果50年前我尝试评估未来会发生什么，那么我的某些预测可能会大大偏离实际情况。在这个警告下，如果我的家人今天问我关于伯克希尔的未来，我会告诉他们什么呢？

Now let’s take a look at the road ahead. Bear in mind that if I had attempted 50 years ago to gauge what was coming, certain of my predictions would have been far off the mark. With that warning, I will tell you what I would say to my family today if they asked me about Berkshire’s future.

<br>

1.首先，也绝对是最重要的，我相信耐心持有伯克希尔股票的投资者永久资本损失的机会几乎是可以在单一公司投资中找到的最低的。这是因为我们每股的内在业务价值几乎肯定会随着时间的推移而增长。

1.First and definitely foremost, I believe that the chance of permanent capital loss for patient Berkshire shareholders is as low as can be found among single-company investments. That’s because our per-share intrinsic business value is almost certain to advance over time.

<br>

然而，这个乐观的预测伴随着一个重要的警告：如果投资者以高于公司回购股票的价格进入伯克希尔股票——比如，接近百分之二百的账面价值，就像伯克希尔股票偶尔达到的那样——可能需要很多年才能实现利润。换句话说，如果以高价购买，一个明智的投资可能会变成冒险的投机。伯克希尔不例外。

This cheery prediction comes, however, with an important caution: If an investor’s entry point into Berkshire stock is unusually high — at a price, say, approaching double book value, which Berkshire shares have occasionally reached — it may well be many years before the investor can realize a profit. In other words, a sound investment can morph into a rash speculation if it is bought at an elevated price. Berkshire is not exempt from this truth.

<br>

然而，以略高于公司回购股票的价格购买伯克希尔的投资者，应该能够在合理的时间内获得收益。伯克希尔的董事会只会在他们认为远低于内在价值的价格下批准回购。在我们看来，这是回购经常被其他管理层忽视的一个重要标准。

Purchases of Berkshire that investors make at a price modestly above the level at which the company would repurchase its shares, however, should produce gains within a reasonable period of time. Berkshire’s directors will only authorize repurchases at a price they believe to be well below intrinsic value. (In our view, that is an essential criterion for repurchases that is often ignored by other managements.)

<br>

对于那些计划在购买后一两年内出售的投资者，我无法提供任何保证，无论购入价格如何。在这种缩短的时间段内，总体股市的波动可能对您的结果产生更大的影响，而不是伯克希尔股票内在价值的同时变化。正如本·格雷厄姆几十年前所说：“短期内，市场是一台投票机；长期内，它则充当一个称重机。” 偶尔，投资者的投票决策，无论是业余投资者还是专业投资者，有时会近乎疯狂。

For those investors who plan to sell within a year or two after their purchase, I can offer no assurances, whatever the entry price. Movements of the general stock market during such abbreviated periods will likely be far more important in determining your results than the concomitant change in the intrinsic value of your Berkshire shares. As Ben Graham said many decades ago: “In the short-term the market is a voting machine; in the long-run it acts as a weighing machine.” Occasionally, the voting decisions of investors — amateurs and professionals alike — border on lunacy.

<br>

由于我不知道如何可靠地预测市场走势，因此我建议您只在预计持有至少五年的情况下购买伯克希尔股票。那些寻求短期利润的人应该另寻他路。

Since I know of no way to reliably predict market movements, I recommend that you purchase Berkshire shares only if you expect to hold them for at least five years. Those who seek short-term profits should look elsewhere.

<br>

另一个警告：伯克希尔股票不应该用借来的资金购买。自1965年以来，我们的股票曾三次从高点下跌约50%。总有一天，会再次发生类似的下跌，而且没有人知道何时会发生。对于投资者来说，伯克希尔几乎肯定是一个满意的投资选择。但对于利用杠杆的投机者来说，这可能是一个灾难性的选择。

Another warning: Berkshire shares should not be purchased with borrowed money. There have been three times since 1965 when our stock has fallen about 50% from its high point. Someday, something close to this kind of drop will happen again, and no one knows when. Berkshire will almost certainly be a satisfactory holding for investors. But it could well be a disastrous choice for speculators employing leverage.

<br>

2.我相信导致伯克希尔陷入财务问题的机会基本上是零。我们将永远为千年一遇的大灾做好准备；事实上，如果发生这种情况，我们将向没有做好准备的人出售救生衣。在2008-2009年的危机中，伯克希尔扮演了“第一响应者”的重要角色，而且自那以后，我们已经将资产负债表的实力和盈利潜力增加了一倍以上。贵公司是美国企业的不可动摇的支柱，将始终如此。

2.I believe the chance of any event causing Berkshire to experience financial problems is essentially zero. We will always be prepared for the thousand-year flood; in fact, if it occurs we will be selling life jackets to the unprepared. Berkshire played an important role as a “first responder” during the 2008-2009 meltdown, and we have since more than doubled the strength of our balance sheet and our earnings potential. Your company is the Gibraltar of American business and will remain so.

<br>

财务稳定力要求公司在任何情况下都保持三个关键因素：（1）大规模且可靠的盈利流；（2）大规模的流动性资产；以及（3）没有重大的近期现金需求。忽视最后一个要点通常会导致公司经历意想不到的问题：太多时候，盈利的公司首席执行官会觉得他们永远能够偿还到期债务，无论这些债务有多大。在2008-2009年，许多管理层都意识到这种心态有多危险。

Financial staying power requires a company to maintain three strengths under all circumstances: (1) a large and reliable stream of earnings; (2) massive liquid assets and (3) no significant near-term cash requirements. Ignoring that last necessity is what usually leads companies to experience unexpected problems: Too often, CEOs of profitable companies feel they will always be able to refund maturing obligations, however large these are. In 2008-2009, many managements learned how perilous that mindset can be.

<br>

以下是我们将始终坚守这三个关键要点的方式。首先，我们的盈利流量巨大，来自各种各样的业务。我们的股东现在拥有许多具有持久竞争优势的大型公司，未来我们还将收购更多这样的公司。我们的多元化确保了伯克希尔的持续盈利，即使一场灾难导致保险损失远远超过以往的任何损失。

Here’s how we will always stand on the three essentials. First, our earnings stream is huge and comes from a vast array of businesses. Our shareholders now own many large companies that have durable competitive advantages, and we will acquire more of those in the future. Our diversification assures Berkshire’s continued profitability, even if a catastrophe causes insurance losses that far exceed any previously experienced.

<br>

接下来是现金。在一个健康的企业中，有时会将现金视为需要最小化的东西——一种无效的资产，对股本回报等指标产生负担。然而，对于企业而言，现金就像对个人而言的氧气一样不可或缺：当它存在时，几乎不会考虑它，但当它不足时，它会成为唯一关心的事物。

Next up is cash. At a healthy business, cash is sometimes thought of as something to be minimized — as an unproductive asset that acts as a drag on such markers as return on equity. Cash, though, is to a business as oxygen is to an individual: never thought about when it is present, the only thing in mind when it is absent.

<br>

2008年，美国企业提供了一个典型案例。那年九月，许多长期繁荣的公司突然担心未来几天自己的支票是否会被退票。一夜之间，它们的财务氧气消失了。

American business provided a case study of that in 2008. In September of that year, many long-prosperous companies suddenly wondered whether their checks would bounce in the days ahead. Overnight, their financial oxygen disappeared.

<br>

在伯克希尔，我们的“呼吸”从未间断。事实上，在2008年九月底到十月初的三周时间内，我们向美国企业提供了1560亿美元的新鲜资金。

At Berkshire, our “breathing” went uninterrupted. Indeed, in a three-week period spanning late September and early October, we supplied $15.6 billion of fresh money to American businesses.

<br>

我们之所以能够做到这一点，是因为我们始终至少保持着200亿美元，通常远远超过这个数字，以备用金的形式。我们所说的备用金是指美国国债，而不是其他声称可以提供流动性的现金替代品，实际上只在真正需要时才能够如此。到期时，只有现金才是法定货币。外出前请务必携带足够的现金。

We could do that because we always maintain at least $20 billion — and usually far more — in cash equivalents. And by that we mean U.S. Treasury bills, not other substitutes for cash that are claimed to deliver liquidity and actually do so, except when it is truly needed. When bills come due, only cash is legal tender. Don’t leave home without it.

<br>

最后一点，我们永远不会从事可能导致突然大额资金需求的经营或投资做法。这意味着我们不会将伯克希尔暴露于大规模短期债务到期或进入衍生合同或其他业务安排可能需要大额担保调用的情况。

Finally — getting to our third point — we will never engage in operating or investment practices that can result in sudden demands for large sums. That means we will not expose Berkshire to short-term debt maturities of size nor enter into derivative contracts or other business arrangements that could require large collateral calls.

<br>

几年前，我们成为某些衍生合同的一方，我们认为这些合同明显定价不准确，而且只需要少量担保。这些合同已被证明非常有利可图。然而，最近编写的衍生合同要求提供充分担保。这结束了我们对衍生品的兴趣，无论它们可能提供什么利润潜力。多年来，我们已不再编写这些合同，除了为我们公用事业业务的操作目的编写了一些合同。

Some years ago, we became a party to certain derivative contracts that we believed were significantly mispriced and that had only minor collateral requirements. These have proved to be quite profitable. Recently, however, newly-written derivative contracts have required full collateralization. And that ended our interest in derivatives, regardless of what profit potential they might offer. We have not, for some years, written these contracts, except for a few needed for operational purposes at our utility businesses.

<br>

此外，我们不会编写那些允许保单持有人随时提取现金的保险合同。许多寿险产品包含赎回条款，使它们容易在极端恐慌时被批量赎回。然而，在我们所经营的财产损失领域，不存在这种类型的合同。即使我们的保费收入减少，我们的保费资金也只会以非常缓慢的速度减少。

Moreover, we will not write insurance contracts that give policyholders the right to cash out at their option. Many life insurance products contain redemption features that make them susceptible to a “run” in times of extreme panic. Contracts of that sort, however, do not exist in the property-casualty world that we inhabit. If our premium volume should shrink, our float would decline — but only at a very slow pace.

<br>

我们之所以如此保守，可能会给一些人留下极端的印象，是因为可以完全预见到人们偶尔会恐慌，但不能预测这将在何时发生。尽管几乎每一天都相对平稳，但明天总是不确定的。（1941年12月6日或2001年9月10日，我都没有特别的担忧。）如果您不能预测明天会发生什么，那么您必须为明天可能发生的任何事情做好准备。

The reason for our conservatism, which may impress some people as extreme, is that it is entirely predictable that people will occasionally panic, but not at all predictable when this will happen. Though practically all days are relatively uneventful, tomorrow is always uncertain. (I felt no special apprehension on December 6, 1941 or September 10, 2001.) And if you can’t predict what tomorrow will bring, you must be prepared for whatever it does.

<br>

一个64岁计划在65岁退休的首席执行官可能会根据一年内发生机会微乎其微的风险进行特殊的计算。事实上，他可能在99%的时间里都是“正确”的。然而，对我们来说，这些机会没有吸引力。即使是隐喻性的枪中有100个弹膛，只有一个子弹，我们也不会冒险失去您托付给我们的资金，即使隐喻的枪中有100个弹膛，只有一个子弹。在我们看来，冒险失去您所需的东西以追求您仅仅渴望的东西是疯狂的。

A CEO who is 64 and plans to retire at 65 may have his own special calculus in evaluating risks that have only a tiny chance of happening in a given year. He may, in fact, be “right” 99% of the time. Those odds, however, hold no appeal for us. We will never play financial Russian roulette with the funds you’ve entrusted to us, even if the metaphorical gun has 100 chambers and only one bullet. In our view, it is madness to risk losing what you need in pursuing what you simply desire.


<br>

3.尽管我们保守谨慎，但我认为我们每年都将能够提升伯克希尔的基础每股盈利能力。这并不意味着经营收益每年都会增加——远非如此。美国经济将会起伏不定，尽管大多数时间会向好发展，但当它疲软时，我们当前的盈利也会受到影响。但我们将继续实现有机增长，进行并购以及进入新领域。因此，我相信伯克希尔将每年都增加其基础盈利能力。

3.Despite our conservatism, I think we will be able every year to build the underlying per-share earning power of Berkshire. That does not mean operating earnings will increase each year — far from it. The U.S. economy will ebb and flow — though mostly flow — and, when it weakens, so will our current earnings. But we will continue to achieve organic gains, make bolt-on acquisitions and enter new fields. I believe, therefore, that Berkshire will annually add to its underlying earning power.

<br>

在某些年份，增益将会很可观，而在其他时候则较小。市场、竞争和机遇将决定机会何时降临。在此过程中，伯克希尔将继续前进，依靠我们现在拥有的一系列坚实企业和我们将要收购的新公司。此外，大多数年份里，我们国家的经济将为企业提供强大的迎风助力。我们有幸将美国视为我们的主场。

In some years the gains will be substantial, and at other times they will be minor. Markets, competition, and chance will determine when opportunities come our way. Through it all, Berkshire will keep moving forward, powered by the array of solid businesses we now possess and the new companies we will purchase. In most years, moreover, our country’s economy will provide a strong tailwind for business. We are blessed to have the United States as our home field.

<br>

4.不好的消息是，伯克希尔的长期增益——以百分比衡量，而不是以美元衡量——不可能是惊人的，也不会接近过去50年所取得的成就。数字已经变得太大了。我认为伯克希尔将会胜过普通美国公司，但如果有任何优势，也不会太大。

4.The bad news is that Berkshire’s long-term gains — measured by percentages, not by dollars — cannot be dramatic and will not come close to those achieved in the past 50 years. The numbers have become too big. I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won’t be great.

<br>

最终——可能在未来十到二十年之间——伯克希尔的收益和资本资源将达到一个水平，不允许管理层明智地再投资公司全部收益。那时，我们的董事们将需要决定通过股息、股份回购或两者结合的方式分配多余的收益。如果伯克希尔的股价低于内在企业价值，大规模回购几乎肯定是最佳选择。您可以放心，您的董事会将会做出正确的决策。

Eventually — probably between ten and twenty years from now — Berkshire’s earnings and capital resources will reach a level that will not allow management to intelligently reinvest all of the company’s earnings. At that time our directors will need to determine whether the best method to distribute the excess earnings is through dividends, share repurchases or both. If Berkshire shares are selling below intrinsic business value, massive repurchases will almost certainly be the best choice. You can be comfortable that your directors will make the right decision.

<br>

5.没有公司比伯克希尔更加注重股东利益。三十多年来，我们每年都再次确认我们的股东原则（请见第117页），始终以以下话语开头：“虽然我们的形式是公司，但我们的态度是合伙关系。”这与您的契约已经铭刻在石头上。

5.No company will be more shareholder-minded than Berkshire. For more than 30 years, we have annually reaffirmed our Shareholder Principles (see page 117), always leading off with: “Although our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership.” This covenant with you is etched in stone.

<br>

我们拥有一支非常博学且以业务为导向的董事会，愿意履行合作伙伴的承诺。他们没有因金钱而担任这个职位：在几乎没有其他地方存在的安排中，我们的董事只获得象征性的报酬。他们通过持有伯克希尔股份来获得回报，以及成为一家重要企业的善良管理者所带来的满足感。

We have an extraordinarily knowledgeable and business-oriented board of directors ready to carry out that promise of partnership. None took the job for the money: In an arrangement almost non-existent elsewhere, our directors are paid only token fees. They receive their rewards instead through ownership of Berkshire shares and the satisfaction that comes from being good stewards of an important enterprise.

<br>

他们和他们家人拥有的股份——在许多情况下，价值非常可观——都是在市场上购买的（而不是通过期权或授予获得的）。此外，与几乎所有其他规模较大的上市公司不同，我们没有董事和高管责任保险。在伯克希尔，董事们与您的立场是一样的。

The shares that they and their families own — which, in many cases, are worth very substantial sums — were purchased in the market (rather than their materializing through options or grants). In addition, unlike almost all other sizable public companies, we carry no directors and officers liability insurance. At Berkshire, directors walk in your shoes.

<br>

为了进一步确保我们文化的延续，我建议我的儿子霍华德接替我成为非执行主席。我之所以有这个愿望，唯一的原因是为了使如果任命了错误的首席执行官，需要主席采取有力措施来进行变革更加容易。我可以向您保证，在伯克希尔这种问题发生的概率非常低，可能与任何其他上市公司一样低。然而，在我服务过的十九家上市公司董事会中，我看到了如果一个平庸的首席执行官同时也是主席，要替换他是多么困难。（通常最终会完成，但几乎总是很晚。）

To further ensure continuation of our culture, I have suggested that my son, Howard, succeed me as a non-executive Chairman. My only reason for this wish is to make change easier if the wrong CEO should ever be employed and there occurs a need for the Chairman to move forcefully. I can assure you that this problem has a very low probability of arising at Berkshire — likely as low as at any public company. In my service on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I’ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocre CEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)

<br>

如果当选，霍华德将不获得薪水，也不会花费除了所有董事都需要的时间以外的任何时间。他只是一个安全阀，任何董事如果对首席执行官有顾虑，并希望了解其他董事是否也有疑虑，可以找他。如果有多个董事感到担忧，霍华德的主席地位将使问题能够迅速而正确地得到解决。

If elected, Howard will receive no pay and will spend no time at the job other than that required of all directors. He will simply be a safety valve to whom any director can go if he or she has concerns about the CEO and wishes to learn if other directors are expressing doubts as well. Should multiple directors be apprehensive, Howard’s chairmanship will allow the matter to be promptly and properly addressed.

<br>

6.选择合适的首席执行官至关重要，这是伯克希尔董事会会议上花费大量时间讨论的课题。管理伯克希尔主要是关于资本配置，同时也涉及到选择和保留出色的管理者来领导我们的运营子公司。当然，这项工作还需要在必要时更换子公司的首席执行官。这些职责要求伯克希尔的首席执行官必须是一个理性、沉稳和果断的人，他对业务有广泛的了解，对人类行为有深刻的洞察力。同样重要的是，他必须知道自己的局限性。（正如IBM的汤姆·沃森·斯尔所说，“我并非天才，但在某些方面很聪明，我会集中精力做那些方面。”）

6.Choosing the right CEO is all-important and is a subject that commands much time at Berkshire board meetings. Managing Berkshire is primarily a job of capital allocation, coupled with the selection and retention of outstanding managers to captain our operating subsidiaries. Obviously, the job also requires the replacement of a subsidiary’s CEO when that is called for. These duties require Berkshire’s CEO to be a rational, calm and decisive individual who has a broad understanding of business and good insights into human behavior. It’s important as well that he knows his limits. (As Tom Watson, Sr. of IBM said, “I’m no genius, but I’m smart in spots and I stay around those spots.”)

<br>

品格至关重要：一位伯克希尔的首席执行官必须全身心地为公司服务，而不是只为个人利益着想。（我使用男性代词以避免措辞上的尴尬，但性别永远不应该决定谁能成为首席执行官。）他难以避免地会赚取远远超过任何可能需要的财富。但重要的是，不论他的成就有多大，都不应该让自己的自负或贪婪驱使他追求与同行最慷慨薪酬相匹配的报酬，即使他的成就远远超过他们的水平。一位首席执行官的行为对下属管理者产生巨大的影响：如果他们清楚地看到股东的利益对他来说是最重要的，他们将在很少例外的情况下也会采纳这种思维方式。

Character is crucial: A Berkshire CEO must be “all in” for the company, not for himself. (I’m using male pronouns to avoid awkward wording, but gender should never decide who becomes CEO.) He can’t help but earn money far in excess of any possible need for it. But it’s important that neither ego nor avarice motivate him to reach for pay matching his most lavishly-compensated peers, even if his achievements far exceed theirs. A CEO’s behavior has a huge impact on managers down the line: If it’s clear to them that shareholders’ interests are paramount to him, they will, with few exceptions, also embrace that way of thinking.

<br>

我的继任者还需要具备另外一种特殊的能力：抵御企业腐化的ABC，即傲慢、官僚主义和自满。当这些企业病变扩散时，即使最强大的公司也可能失利。证明这一点的例子有很多，但为了保持友好关系，我只会挖掘遥远过去的案例。

My successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay, which are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency. When these corporate cancers metastasize, even the strongest of companies can falter. The examples available to prove the point are legion, but to maintain friendships I will exhume only cases from the distant past.

<br>

在它们的辉煌时期，通用汽车、IBM、西尔斯-罗巴克（Sears Roebuck）和美国钢铁公司（U.S. Steel）都是庞大产业的领头羊。它们的优势似乎无可撼动。但我在上文所痛斥的破坏性行为最终导致它们各自跌落到其首席执行官和董事们不久前还认为不可能的深渊。事实证明，它们曾经的雄厚财力和历史盈利能力都无法抵挡。

In their glory days, General Motors, IBM, Sears Roebuck and U.S. Steel sat atop huge industries. Their strengths seemed unassailable. But the destructive behavior I deplored above eventually led each of them to fall to depths that their CEOs and directors had not long before thought impossible. Their one-time financial strength and their historical earning power proved no defense.

<br>

在伯克希尔日益壮大的过程中，只有警觉而坚定的首席执行官才能抵御这种削弱力量。他决不能忘记查理的恳求： "告诉我死在哪里，我就不会去那里" 如果我们的非经济价值丧失殆尽，伯克希尔的大部分经济价值也将随之崩溃。要保持伯克希尔的特殊文化，"高层语调 "将是关键。

Only a vigilant and determined CEO can ward off such debilitating forces as Berkshire grows ever larger. He must never forget Charlie’s plea: “Tell me where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there.” If our noneconomic values were to be lost, much of Berkshire’s economic value would collapse as well. “Tone at the top” will be key to maintaining Berkshire’s special culture.

<br>

幸运的是，我们未来的首席执行官取得成功所需的结构已经稳固建立。伯克希尔现有的非凡授权是官僚主义的理想解药。从运营意义上讲，伯克希尔不是一家巨型公司，而是多家大公司的集合体。在总部，我们从未设立过委员会，也从未要求子公司提交预算（尽管许多子公司将预算作为重要的内部工具）。我们没有法律办公室，也没有其他公司认为理所当然的部门：人际关系部、公共关系部、投资者关系部、战略部、收购部等等。

Fortunately, the structure our future CEOs will need to be successful is firmly in place. The extraordinary delegation of authority now existing at Berkshire is the ideal antidote to bureaucracy. In an operating sense, Berkshire is not a giant company but rather a collection of large companies. At headquarters, we have never had a committee nor have we ever required our subsidiaries to submit budgets (though many use them as an important internal tool). We don’t have a legal office nor departments that other companies take for granted: human relations, public relations, investor relations, strategy, acquisitions, you name it.

<br>

当然，我们有一个积极的审计职能部门；做一个该死的傻瓜是没有意义的。不过，我们在某种程度上异常信任我们的经理人，相信他们会以敏锐的管理意识来经营业务。毕竟，在我们收购他们的企业之前，他们正是这样做的。此外，除了偶尔的例外情况，我们的信任所产生的结果比层层指令、无休止的审查和层层官僚主义所产生的结果要好得多。查理和我努力与我们的经理们进行互动，如果我们的立场颠倒过来，我们也会这样做。

We do, of course, have an active audit function; no sense being a dammed fool. To an unusual degree, however, we trust our managers to run their operations with a keen sense of stewardship. After all, they were doing exactly that before we acquired their businesses. With only occasional exceptions, furthermore, our trust produces better results than would be achieved by streams of directives, endless reviews and layers of bureaucracy. Charlie and I try to interact with our managers in a manner consistent with what we would wish for, if the positions were reversed.

<br>

7.我们的董事认为，我们未来的首席执行官应该来自伯克希尔董事会非常熟悉的内部候选人。我们的董事还认为，即将上任的首席执行官应该相对年轻，这样他或她才能在这个职位上长期工作。如果首席执行官的平均执掌年限超过十年，伯克希尔的运营将达到最佳状态。(他们也不可能在 65 岁退休（你注意到了吗？）

7.Our directors believe that our future CEOs should come from internal candidates whom the Berkshire board has grown to know well. Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relatively young, so that he or she can have a long run in the job. Berkshire will operate best if its CEOs average well over ten years at the helm. (It’s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.) And they are not likely to retire at 65 either (or have you noticed?).

<br>

在伯克希尔的业务收购和大型定制投资活动中，我们的交易对手必须熟悉伯克希尔的首席执行官，并对其感到满意。培养这种信心和巩固关系需要时间。但回报可能是巨大的。

In both Berkshire’s business acquisitions and large, tailored investment moves, it is important that our counterparties be both familiar with and feel comfortable with Berkshire’s CEO. Developing confidence of that sort and cementing relationships takes time. The payoff, though, can be huge.

<br>

董事会和我都相信，我们现在已经有了接替我担任首席执行官的合适人选--一个可以在我去世或卸任后第二天上任的继任者。在某些重要方面，他将比我做得更好。

Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO — a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down. In certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing.

<br>

8.投资对伯克希尔来说始终非常重要，将由几位专家负责。他们将向首席执行官汇报，因为他们的投资决策在很大程度上需要与伯克希尔的运营和收购计划相协调。但总的来说，我们的投资经理将享有极大的自主权。在这一领域，我们在未来几十年也将处于良好的状态。托德-康博斯（Todd Combs）和泰德-韦施勒（Ted Weschler）都曾在伯克希尔的投资团队工作过数年，他们在各方面都是一流的，尤其能帮助首席执行官评估收购项目。

8.Investments will always be of great importance to Berkshire and will be handled by several specialists. They will report to the CEO because their investment decisions, in a broad way, will need to be coordinated with Berkshire’s operating and acquisition programs. Overall, though, our investment managers will enjoy great autonomy. In this area, too, we are in fine shape for decades to come. Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, each of whom has spent several years on Berkshire’s investment team, are first-rate in all respects and can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions.

<br>

总而言之，伯克希尔为查理和我离开后的生活做好了理想的准备。我们拥有合适的人才--合适的董事、经理和这些经理的未来继任者。此外，我们的文化已经深入到他们的队伍中。我们的系统还具有再生能力。在很大程度上，好的文化和坏的文化都会自我选择，使自己永久存在。出于很好的理由，拥有与我们相似价值观的企业主和运营经理将继续被伯克希尔吸引，将其视为独一无二的永久家园。

All told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie and I leave the scene. We have the right people in place — the right directors, managers and prospective successors to those managers. Our culture, furthermore, is embedded throughout their ranks. Our system is also regenerative. To a large degree, both good and bad cultures self-select to perpetuate themselves. For very good reasons, business owners and operating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kind and permanent home.

<br>

9.如果我不向使伯克希尔与众不同的另一个关键群体--我们的股东--致敬，那将是我的失职。伯克希尔真正拥有与其他任何巨型公司都不同的股东基础。这一事实在去年的年会上得到了充分体现，股东们在会上通过了一项代理决议：

9.I would be remiss if I didn’t salute another key constituency that makes Berkshire special: our shareholders. Berkshire truly has an owner base unlike that of any other giant corporation. That fact was demonstrated in spades at last year’s annual meeting, where the shareholders were offered a proxy resolution:

<br>

决议：鉴于公司的资金超过其需求，而且公司所有者与沃伦不同，都不是亿万富翁，董事会应考虑每年支付有意义的股票股息。

RESOLVED: Whereas the corporation has more money than it needs and since the owners unlike Warren are not multi billionaires, the board shall consider paying a meaningful annual dividend on the shares.

<br>

该决议的提案股东从未出席会议，因此他的动议没有被正式提出。不过，代理投票已经统计出来，而且很有启发性。

The sponsoring shareholder of that resolution never showed up at the meeting, so his motion was not officially proposed. Nevertheless, the proxy votes had been tallied, and they were enlightening.

<br>

不足为奇的是，A 股（股东人数相对较少，但每个股东都拥有巨大的经济利益）在股息问题上以 89 票对 1 票的比例投了反对票。

Not surprisingly, the A shares — owned by relatively few shareholders, each with a large economic interest — voted “no” on the dividend question by a margin of 89 to 1.

<br>

最引人注目的是我们的 B 股股东。他们有几十万人，甚至可能有一百万人，他们投了 660,759,855 票 "反对 "和 13,927,026 票 "赞成"，比例约为 47:1。

The remarkable vote was that of our B shareholders. They number in the hundreds of thousands — perhaps even totaling one million — and they voted 660,759,855 “no” and 13,927,026 “yes,” a ratio of about 47 to 1.

<br>

我们的董事建议投 "反对 "票，但公司并未试图以其他方式影响股东。尽管如此，98% 的投票股份实际上是在说："不要给我们派发股息，而是将所有收益再投资"。我们的大小股东们与我们的管理理念如此一致，这既了不起，也很有意义。

Our directors recommended a “no” vote but the company did not otherwise attempt to influence shareholders. Nevertheless, 98% of the shares voting said, in effect, “Don’t send us a dividend but instead reinvest all of the earnings.” To have our fellow owners — large and small — be so in sync with our managerial philosophy is both remarkable and rewarding.

<br>

我很幸运能与你们成为合作伙伴。

I am a lucky fellow to have you as partners.

</p>

<br>

亲爱的伯克希尔哈撒韦股东们：

To the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:

<br>

我密切关注了伯克希尔哈撒韦在沃伦·巴菲特的领导下取得的50年非凡成功历程。现在，独立地补充一下他所发表的任何庆祝性评论似乎是合适的。我将尝试做五件事情：

I closely watched the 50-year history of Berkshire’s uncommon success under Warren Buffett. And it now seems appropriate that I independently supplement whatever celebratory comment comes from him. I will try to do five things.

<br>

1.描述导致一家小型、注定无法挽救的商品纺织企业，如何演变成如今强大的伯克希尔的管理体系和政策。

1.Describe the management system and policies that caused a small and unfixably-doomed commodity textile business to morph into the mighty Berkshire that now exists,

<br>

2.解释管理体系和政策的形成过程。

2.Explain how the management system and policies came into being,

<br>

3.在一定程度上解释伯克希尔为何表现出色。

3.Explain, to some extent, why Berkshire did so well,

<br>

4.预测如果巴菲特很快离开，是否会继续取得异常出色的业绩。

4.Predict whether abnormally good results would continue if Buffett were soon to depart, and

<br>

5.考虑伯克希尔在过去50年取得的非凡成就是否具有可能在其他地方有用的含义。

5.Consider whether Berkshire’s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may prove useful elsewhere.

<br>

伯克希尔在巴菲特（以下统称为“伯克希尔体系”）的管理体制和政策早已确定，如下所述：

The management system and policies of Berkshire under Buffett (herein together called “the Berkshire system”) were fixed early and are described below:

<br>

1.伯克希尔将成为一个分散的企业集团，只对无法做出有用预测的活动持避免态度。

1.Berkshire would be a diffuse conglomerate, averse only to activities about which it could not make useful predictions.

<br>

2.其顶级公司几乎所有业务都将通过独立的子公司进行，这些子公司的首席执行官将拥有极高的自主权。

2.Its top company would do almost all business through separately incorporated subsidiaries whose CEOs would operate with very extreme autonomy.

<br>

3.集团总部几乎没有其他人员，只有一个小小的办公套间，其中包括主席、首席财务官和几名主要协助首席财务官进行审计、内部控制等的助手。

3.There would be almost nothing at conglomerate headquarters except a tiny office suite containing a Chairman, a CFO, and a few assistants who mostly helped the CFO with auditing, internal control, etc.

<br>

4.伯克希尔的子公司将始终包括财产险公司。预计这些保险公司将作为一个群体，产生可靠的承保盈利，同时产生大量的“浮动资金”（来自未支付的保险赔款），用于投资。

4.Berkshire subsidiaries would always prominently include casualty insurers. Those insurers as a group would be expected to produce, in due course, dependable underwriting gains while also producing substantial “float” (from unpaid insurance liabilities) for investment.

<br>

5.由于子公司将拥有自己的系统，通常是不同的，所以不会有重要的系统范围的人事系统、股票期权系统、其他激励系统、退休制度等。

5.There would be no significant system-wide personnel system, stock option system, other incentive system, retirement system, or the like, because the subsidiaries would have their own systems, often different.

<br>

6.伯克希尔的主席将仅保留一些活动：

6.Berkshire’s Chairman would reserve only a few activities for himself.

<br>

i.他将管理几乎所有的证券投资，这些投资通常位于伯克希尔的财产险公司。

i.He would manage almost all security investments, with these normally residing in Berkshire’s casualty insurers.

<br>

ii.他将挑选所有重要子公司的首席执行官，并确定他们的薪酬，并从每位首席执行官那里获取在需要时能立即提供的继任者的私人推荐。

ii.He would choose all CEOs of important subsidiaries, and he would fix their compensation and obtain from each a private recommendation for a successor in case one was suddenly needed.

<br>

iii.他将在不需要的子公司增加竞争优势后，部署大部分现金，理想的部署是将这些现金用于收购新的子公司。

iii.He would deploy most cash not needed in subsidiaries after they had increased their competitive advantage, with the ideal deployment being the use of that cash to acquire new subsidiaries.

<br>

iv.他将迅速提供给任何子公司首席执行官希望的几乎所有联系，并且几乎不需要额外的联系。

iv.He would make himself promptly available for almost any contact wanted by any subsidiary’s CEO, and he would require almost no additional contact.

<br>

v.他将撰写一封长篇、逻辑且有用的信件，设计成如果他只是一名被动股东时希望它的样子，并将在年度股东大会上花费数小时回答问题。

v.He would write a long, logical, and useful letter for inclusion in his annual report, designed as he would wish it to be if he were only a passive shareholder, and he would be available for hours of answering questions at annual shareholders’ meetings.

<br>

vi.他将努力成为一种对顾客、股东和其他利益相关者都能长期运作良好的文化的楷模，不论在他离开前后都是如此。

vi.He would try to be an exemplar in a culture that would work well for customers, shareholders, and other incumbents for a long time, both before and after his departure.

<br>

vii.他的首要任务将是为安静的阅读和思考保留大量时间，特别是那些可能推动他的不断学习的时间，无论他年龄多大；

vii.His first priority would be reservation of much time for quiet reading and thinking, particularly that which might advance his determined learning, no matter how old he became; and

<br>

viii.并且他还将花费大量时间热情地欣赏其他人所取得的成就。

viii.He would also spend much time in enthusiastically admiring what others were accomplishing.

<br>

7.新子公司通常会用现金购买，而不是新发行的股票。

7.New subsidiaries would usually be bought with cash, not newly issued stock.

<br>

8.只要每一美元的留存收益能为股东创造一美元以上的市值，伯克希尔不会支付股息。

8.Berkshire would not pay dividends so long as more than one dollar of market value for shareholders was being created by each dollar of retained earnings.

<br>

9.在购买新子公司时，伯克希尔会寻求以合理的价格收购一家优质企业，而主席能够相当了解该企业。伯克希尔还希望有一位优秀的首席执行官，预计将长期任职，并且能够在不需要总部帮助的情况下有效管理。

9.In buying a new subsidiary, Berkshire would seek to pay a fair price for a good business that the Chairman could pretty well understand. Berkshire would also want a good CEO in place, one expected to remain for a long time and to manage well without need for help from headquarters.

<br>

10.在选择子公司首席执行官时，伯克希尔会努力确保他们的可信度、技能、活力，以及对所在行业和环境的热爱。

10.In choosing CEOs of subsidiaries, Berkshire would try to secure trustworthiness, skill, energy, and love for the business and circumstances the CEO was in.

<br>

11.作为首选行为的重要事项，伯克希尔几乎永远不会出售子公司。

11.As an important matter of preferred conduct, Berkshire would almost never sell a subsidiary.

<br>

12.伯克希尔几乎不会将子公司的首席执行官调至其他无关的子公司。

12.Berkshire would almost never transfer a subsidiary’s CEO to another unrelated subsidiary.

<br>

13.伯克希尔永远不会因年龄而强迫子公司首席执行官退休。

13.Berkshire would never force the CEO of a subsidiary to retire on account of mere age.

<br>

14.伯克希尔会保持较低的债务，以保持在各种情况下（i）几乎完美的信用和（ii）轻松获得现金和信贷，以应对出现不寻常机会的时刻。

14.Berkshire would have little debt outstanding as it tried to maintain (i) virtually perfect creditworthiness under all conditions and (ii) easy availability of cash and credit for deployment in times presenting unusual opportunities.

<br>

15.伯克希尔始终对欲出售大型企业的潜在卖家友好。这样的业务提议将得到迅速的关注。如果没有导致交易，除了主席和伯克希尔的一两位高管外，没有人会知道这一提议。他们也不会向外界透露。

15.Berkshire would always be user-friendly to a prospective seller of a large business. An offer of such a business would get prompt attention. No one but the Chairman and one or two others at Berkshire would ever know about the offer if it did not lead to a transaction. And they would never tell outsiders about it.

<br>

伯克希尔（Berkshire）的制度要素和其规模之大都非常不同寻常。我不知道其他任何一家大公司有半数以上的这种制度要素。
Both the elements of the Berkshire system and their collected size are quite unusual. No other large corporation I know of has half of such elements in place.

<br>

伯克希尔是如何获得与众不同的企业性格的呢？

How did Berkshire happen to get a corporate personality so different from the norm?

<br>

嗯，巴菲特（Buffett）即使在34岁的时候，也控制了伯克希尔约45%的股份，并且得到了所有其他大股东的完全信任。他可以安装任何他想要的制度。而他确实这么做了，创造了伯克希尔的制度。

Well, Buffett, even when only 34 years old, controlled about 45% of Berkshire’s shares and was completely trusted by all the other big shareholders. He could install whatever system he wanted. And he did so, creating the Berkshire system.

<br>

几乎每个要素都是因为巴菲特认为，在他的领导下，它将有助于最大化伯克希尔的业绩而选择的。他并不试图为其他公司创建一种适合所有情况的制度。实际上，伯克希尔的子公司并不需要在自己的业务中使用伯克希尔的制度。有些公司采用不同的制度也一样蓬勃发展。

Almost every element was chosen because Buffett believed that, under him, it would help maximize Berkshire’s achievement. He was not trying to create a one-type-fits-all system for other corporations. Indeed, Berkshire’s subsidiaries were not required to use the Berkshire system in their own operations. And some flourished while using different systems.

<br>

那么，巴菲特在设计伯克希尔的制度时的目标是什么呢？

What was Buffett aiming at as he designed the Berkshire system?

<br>

嗯，多年来，我诊断出了一些重要的主题：

Well, over the years I diagnosed several important themes:

<br>

1.他特别希望系统中最重要的人，从他自己开始，能够不断提高理性、技能和投入度。

1.He particularly wanted continuous maximization of the rationality, skills, and devotion of the most important people in the system, starting with himself.

<br>

2.他希望在任何地方都能取得双赢的结果，比如通过给予忠诚来获得忠诚。

2.He wanted win/win results everywhere—in gaining loyalty by giving it, for instance.

<br>

3.他希望能够做出最大化长期效益的决策，并从那些通常能够长时间留在岗位上承担决策后果的决策者那里寻求这种决策。

3.He wanted decisions that maximized long-term results, seeking these from decision makers who usually stayed long enough in place to bear the consequences of decisions.

<br>

4.他希望能够将总部大型官僚体制几乎不可避免带来的负面影响降至最低。

4.He wanted to minimize the bad effects that would almost inevitably come from a large bureaucracy at headquarters.

<br>

5.他希望能够像本·格雷厄姆教授一样，为传播所获智慧作出个人贡献。

5.He wanted to personally contribute, like Professor Ben Graham, to the spread of wisdom attained.

<br>

当巴菲特开发伯克希尔体系时，是否预见到了随之而来的所有好处呢？并不是。巴菲特通过实践演进偶然获得了一些好处。但是，当他看到有用的后果时，他加强了它们的原因。

When Buffett developed the Berkshire system, did he foresee all the benefits that followed? No. Buffett stumbled into some benefits through practice evolution. But, when he saw useful consequences, he strengthened their causes.

<br>

为什么在巴菲特的领导下，伯克希尔表现得如此出色？我只能想到四个主要因素：

Why did Berkshire under Buffett do so well? Only four large factors occur to me:

<br>

1.巴菲特的建设性特质，

1.The constructive peculiarities of Buffett,

<br>

2.伯克希尔体系的建设性特质，

2.The constructive peculiarities of the Berkshire system,

<br>

3.好运气，以及

3.Good luck, and

<br>

4.一些股东和其他崇拜者的异常热情和感染力，包括一些媒体。

4.The weirdly intense, contagious devotion of some shareholders and other admirers, including some in the press.

<br>

我相信所有四个因素都存在并且起到了帮助作用。但是最重要的负担是由建设性特质、奇怪的热情以及它们的相互作用承担的。

I believe all four factors were present and helpful. But the heavy freight was carried by the constructive peculiarities, the weird devotion, and their interactions.

<br>

特别是，巴菲特决定将他的活动限制在几种领域，并最大程度地关注它们，然后坚持这样做了50年，这是一场lollapalooza。巴菲特之所以成功，原因与罗杰·费德勒成为一名优秀的网球运动员相同。

In particular, Buffett’s decision to limit his activities to a few kinds and to maximize his attention to them, and to keep doing so for 50 years, was a lollapalooza. Buffett succeeded for the same reason Roger Federer became good at tennis.

<br>

实际上，巴菲特采用了著名篮球教练约翰·伍登的胜利方法，后者在学会将几乎所有比赛时间分配给他的七名最佳球员之后，经常获得胜利。这样，对手总是面对他最佳的球员，而不是次佳的球员。而且，由于额外的比赛时间，最佳球员的进步超过了正常水平。

Buffett was, in effect, using the winning method of the famous basketball coach, John Wooden, who won most regularly after he had learned to assign virtually all playing time to his seven best players. That way, opponents always faced his best players, instead of his second best. And, with the extra playing time, the best players improved more than was normal.

<br>

而巴菲特在这方面表现得比伍登更出色，因为在他的情况下，技能的发挥集中在一个人身上，而不是七个人，而且他的技能在50年间不断提高，而不像篮球运动员的技能会衰退。

And Buffett much out-Woodened Wooden, because in his case the exercise of skill was concentrated in one person, not seven, and his skill improved and improved as he got older and older during 50 years, instead of deteriorating like the skill of a basketball player does.

<br>

而且，通过将如此多的权力和权威集中在经常长期任职的重要子公司首席执行官手中，巴菲特也在那里创造了强烈的伍登式效应。这些效应增强了首席执行官的技能以及子公司的业绩。

Moreover, by concentrating so much power and authority in the often-long-serving CEOs of important subsidiaries, Buffett was also creating strong Wooden-type effects there. And such effects enhanced the skills of the CEOs and the achievements of the subsidiaries.

<br>

然后，随着伯克希尔体系赋予许多子公司和其首席执行官所渴望的自治权，并且伯克希尔变得成功并广为人知，这些结果吸引了更多更好的子公司加入伯克希尔，以及更优秀的首席执行官。

Then, as the Berkshire system bestowed much-desired autonomy on many subsidiaries and their CEOs, and Berkshire became successful and well known, these outcomes attracted both more and better subsidiaries into Berkshire, and better CEOs as well.

<br>

而更好的子公司和首席执行官则需要总部的注意力较少，从而形成了通常所称的“良性循环”。

And the better subsidiaries and CEOs then required less attention from headquarters, creating what is often called a “virtuous circle.”

<br>

伯克希尔始终将财险公司列为重要子公司，这一策略运作得如何？

How well did it work out for Berkshire to always include casualty insurers as important subsidiaries?

<br>

非常出色。伯克希尔的雄心壮志非常过分，尽管如此，它还是得到了想要的结果。

Marvelously well. Berkshire’s ambitions were unreasonably extreme and, even so, it got what it wanted.

<br>

财险公司通常将投资的公共股票价值大致等于其股东权益，正如伯克希尔的保险子公司所做的那样。而标普500指数在过去50年中前税前每年产生了约10%的收益，为其提供了显著的顺风支持。

Casualty insurers often invest in common stocks with a value amounting roughly to their shareholders’ equity, as did Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries. And the S&P 500 Index produced about 10% per annum, pre-tax, during the last 50 years, creating a significant tailwind.

<br>

而且，在巴菲特时代的早期几十年里，伯克希尔的保险子公司内的普通股大大超过了指数，正如巴菲特所预期的那样。后来，由于伯克希尔的股票持有规模庞大以及税收考虑因素导致超越指数的回报部分消失得无影无踪（也许并非永久性的），其他更好的优势出现了。阿吉特·贾因（Ajit Jain）凭空创造了一个巨大的再保险业务，产生了巨额的“浮动资金”和大幅度的承保收益。而所有的GEICO也被纳入了伯克希尔，随后GEICO的市场份额翻了四倍。伯克希尔的其他保险业务也有了巨大的改进，主要是因为声誉优势、承保纪律、找到并保持在良好的领域内，以及招聘和留住杰出的人员。

And, in the early decades of the Buffett era, common stocks within Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries greatly outperformed the index, exactly as Buffett expected. And, later, when both the large size of Berkshire’s stockholdings and income tax considerations caused the index-beating part of returns to fade to insignificance (perhaps not forever), other and better advantage came. Ajit Jain created out of nothing an immense reinsurance business that produced both a huge “float” and a large underwriting gain. And all of GEICO came into Berkshire, followed by a quadrupling of GEICO’s market share. And the rest of Berkshire’s insurance operations hugely improved, largely by dint of reputational advantage, underwriting discipline, finding and staying within good niches, and recruiting and holding outstanding people.

<br>

后来，随着伯克希尔几乎独特且非常可靠的企业性格和庞大规模的知名度，其保险子公司获得并抓住了许多有吸引力的机会，其他人无法获得，以购买私人发行的证券。这些大多数证券都有固定到期日，并产生了杰出的结果。

Then, later, as Berkshire’s nearly unique and quite dependable corporate personality and large size became well known, its insurance subsidiaries got and seized many attractive opportunities, not available to others, to buy privately issued securities. Most of these securities had fixed maturities and produced outstanding results.

<br>

伯克希尔在保险方面的出色成果并不是自然而然的结果。通常情况下，意外险业务是产生平庸结果的生产者，即使管理得很好。而这种结果没有多大用处。伯克希尔的更好结果如此之大，以至于我相信，如果巴菲特回到一个小基础但保留他的智慧并重返青春，他现在将无法重现这一成就。

Berkshire’s marvelous outcome in insurance was not a natural result. Ordinarily, a casualty insurance business is a producer of mediocre results, even when very well managed. And such results are of little use. Berkshire’s better outcome was so astoundingly large that I believe that Buffett would now fail to recreate it if he returned to a small base while retaining his smarts and regaining his youth.

<br>

伯克希尔因为是一个分散的多元化企业集团而受到困扰吗？不，它的机会因为扩大了经营范围而变得有用。而其他地方常见的不良影响都被巴菲特的技巧所防止。

Did Berkshire suffer from being a diffuse conglomerate? No, its opportunities were usefully enlarged by a widened area for operation. And bad effects, common elsewhere, were prevented by Buffett’s skills.

<br>

伯克希尔为什么更喜欢用现金购买公司，而不是用自己的股票？嗯，很难用伯克希尔的股票换取与所放弃的同等价值的东西。

Why did Berkshire prefer to buy companies with cash, instead of its own stock? Well, it was hard to get anything in exchange for Berkshire stock that was as valuable as what was given up.

<br>

伯克希尔收购保险业之外的公司为什么对伯克希尔的股东而言效果如此好，而在此类收购中的正常结果对收购方的股东来说通常是不利的？

Why did Berkshire’s acquisition of companies outside the insurance business work out so well for Berkshire shareholders when the normal result in such acquisitions is bad for shareholders of the acquirer?

<br>

嗯，伯克希尔的设计使其在更好的机会之外还拥有方法论上的优势。它从未有过相当于“收购部门”的部门，不受购买压力影响。它也从不依赖于“助手”的建议，这些助手肯定会偏向于交易。巴菲特将自我欺骗拒之门外，虽然他比大多数企业高管更清楚业务中的得失，受到他作为被动投资者长期经验的帮助。最后，即使在伯克希尔得到比大多数其他人更好的机会时，巴菲特常常表现出近乎不人性的耐心，很少购买。例如，在他掌控伯克希尔的前十年，巴菲特看到一家企业（纺织业）濒临破产，而又引入了两家新企业，净增加了一家。

Well, Berkshire, by design, had methodological advantages to supplement its better opportunities. It never had the equivalent of a “department of acquisitions” under pressure to buy. And it never relied on advice from “helpers” sure to be prejudiced in favor of transactions. And Buffett held self-delusion at bay as he underclaimed expertise while he knew better than most corporate executives what worked and what didn’t in business, aided by his long experience as a passive investor. And, finally, even when Berkshire was getting much better opportunities than most others, Buffett often displayed almost inhuman patience and seldom bought. For instance, during his first ten years in control of Berkshire, Buffett saw one business (textiles) move close to death and two new businesses come in, for a net gain of one.

<br>

伯克希尔在巴菲特的领导下犯了哪些重大错误呢？嗯，虽然做出错误决策是常见的，但几乎所有巨大的错误都是因为未能进行投资，包括没有购买沃尔玛股票，而那几乎肯定会取得巨大成功。遗漏的错误非常重要。如果当时足够聪明去认识到这些几乎是确定的事情并抓住了其中的几次机会，伯克希尔的净资产现在至少会高出500亿美元。

What were the big mistakes made by Berkshire under Buffett? Well, while mistakes of commission were common, almost all huge errors were in not making a purchase, including not purchasing Walmart stock when that was sure to work out enormously well. The errors of omission were of much importance. Berkshire’s net worth would now be at least $50 billion higher if it had seized several opportunities it was not quite smart enough to recognize as virtually sure things.

<br>

我列表上倒数第二项任务是：预测如果巴菲特即将离世，伯克希尔是否会继续取得异常出色的业绩。

The next to last task on my list was: Predict whether abnormally good results would continue at Berkshire if Buffett were soon to depart.

<br>

答案是肯定的。伯克希尔在其子公司中拥有很多业务势头，这些势头基于持久的竞争优势。

The answer is yes. Berkshire has in place in its subsidiaries much business momentum grounded in much durable competitive advantage.

<br>

此外，它的铁路和公用事业子公司现在提供了大量有吸引力的投资机会，用于投资新的固定资产。而且许多子公司现在正致力于进行明智的“附加”收购。

Moreover, its railroad and utility subsidiaries now provide much desirable opportunity to invest large sums in new fixed assets. And many subsidiaries are now engaged in making wise “bolt-on” acquisitions.

<br>

前提是伯克希尔的大部分体系保持不变，目前所具备的合并势头和机会如此之大，伯克希尔几乎肯定会在很长时间内保持高于正常水平的公司，以至于即使：

Provided that most of the Berkshire system remains in place, the combined momentum and opportunity now present is so great that Berkshire would almost surely remain a better-than-normal company for a very long time even if

<br>

（1）巴菲特明天离开，（2）他的继任者只具有中等能力，以及（3）伯克希尔再也不购买大型企业。

(1) Buffett left tomorrow, (2) his successors were persons of only moderate ability, and (3) Berkshire never again purchased a large business.

<br>

但在这个巴菲特即将离去的假设下，他的继任者不会仅仅具有“中等能力”。例如，阿吉特·贾因（Ajit Jain）和格雷格·阿贝尔（Greg Abel）是经验丰富的表现出色的人，他们很可能不应该仅被描述为“世界级”。我会选择描述他们为“世界领先”。在某些重要方面，他们中的每一个都是比巴菲特更好的业务高管。

But, under this Buffett-soon-leaves assumption, his successors would not be “of only moderate ability.” For instance, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel are proven performers who would probably be under-described as “world-class.” “World-leading” would be the description I would choose. In some important ways, each is a better business executive than Buffett.

<br>

而且，我相信无论发生什么情况，贾因和阿贝尔都不会（1）离开伯克希尔，也不会（2）渴望对伯克希尔体系进行太多改变。

And I believe neither Jain nor Abel would (1) leave Berkshire, no matter what someone else offered or (2) desire much change in the Berkshire system.

<br>

我也不认为，在巴菲特离开后，购买新企业的愿望将结束。由于伯克希尔现在规模如此之大，激进主义的时代已经来临，我认为一些有吸引力的收购机会将出现，并且伯克希尔的600亿美元现金将会有建设性地减少。

Nor do I think that desirable purchases of new businesses would end with Buffett’s departure. With Berkshire now so large and the age of activism upon us, I think some desirable acquisition opportunities will come and that Berkshire’s $60 billion in cash will constructively decrease.

<br>

我的最后任务是考虑伯克希尔在过去50年取得的卓越成绩是否具有可能在其他地方产生有用影响的含义。

My final task was to consider whether Berkshire’s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may prove useful elsewhere.

<br>

答案显然是肯定的。在巴菲特早期的伯克希尔时代，公司面临着巨大的任务：将一小笔资金变成一家庞大而有用的公司。它通过避免官僚主义，长期依赖一个充满思考的领导者，不断改进并引入更多像他自己这样的人来解决这个问题。

The answer is plainly yes. In its early Buffett years, Berkshire had a big task ahead: turning a tiny stash into a large and useful company. And it solved that problem by avoiding bureaucracy and relying much on one thoughtful leader for a long, long time as he kept improving and brought in more people like himself.

<br>

与典型的大型公司体系相比，后者在总部设有大量官僚机构，CEO的长期继任通常在大约59岁时上任，之后很少有时间进行深思熟虑，很快就会因强制退休年龄而被迫离职。

Compare this to a typical big-corporation system with much bureaucracy at headquarters and a long succession of CEOs who come in at about age 59, pause little thereafter for quiet thought, and are soon forced out by a fixed retirement age.

<br>

我认为伯克希尔体系的版本应该更经常在其他地方尝试，并且官僚主义的最坏特征应该更经常地被视为它们所相似的癌症。官僚主义的修复的一个很好的例子是由乔治·马歇尔（George Marshall）创造的，他通过获得国会的权利来选择将军时可以忽略资历的问题，从而帮助赢得了第二次世界大战。

I believe that versions of the Berkshire system should be tried more often elsewhere and that the worst attributes of bureaucracy should much more often be treated like the cancers they so much resemble. A good example of bureaucracy fixing was created by George Marshall when he helped win World War II by getting from Congress the right to ignore seniority in choosing generals.

<br>

真诚地，

Sincerely,

date: 2022-09-11

你想给每一个普通人的建议是什么？
What advice would you give the average person in the U.S.?

<br>

巴菲特：对于可能会失去工作的人来说，其实很难有什么好建议。我父亲在1931年8月13号上班的时候发现他工作和存钱的银行已经倒闭了。当时他没有工作没有存款，还有两个小孩需要抚养。因此我的建议是尽可能对意外多做准备并且不要有贷款消费。如果你健康出现了问题，未来给你带来很多痛苦，并且会让你陷入债务。贷款消费是会害了你的。如果你赚了1美金，那么想办法只花其中的95美分，而不是想办法花1.05美金。你应该想办法提前做好准备而不是填补过去的问题，因为走出困境总是更加困难的事情。你应该去做那些你擅长的事情，并且你要为未来计划。人们在一切都好的时候并不愿意听从建议。而人性会让普通人赌上那些他们已经拥有的东西，去博取那些他们不一定需要的事物。查理曾经说过：“问题不在于如何致富，而是保持冷静”
Buffett: It’s hard to give advice to someone who might lose their job. My Dad went to work on August 13, 1931 to find out the bank where he worked and held all our money had closed. He had no job and no money and two kids. You want to be as prepared as you can and you just don’t want to have debt. Medical problems cause a lot of the grief and lots of credit card debt. Credit cards are poison. If you make a dollar, only spend 95 cents, not $1.05. You should be ahead of the game all the time rather than behind as it is harder to work your way out of a hole. You want to play the game from strength, and you have to think ahead. People don’t always want to hear advice when things are going well. People risked everything they had and needed for something they didn’t have or need. Charlie once said, “The problem isn’t getting rich, it’s staying sane.

### 史提夫福布斯：你以前投资华盛顿邮报，水牛城新闻报，当时看来IQ30就能运营良好的公司，如今却遭到了危机，你怎么看？

<br>

巴菲特：什么都有可能发生的。有轨电车曾经在奥马哈到处都是。但是关于投资我会说这一点，你学的一切都是可以积累的。产业会变，公司会变，但是学习如何分析商业模式，我在20,25岁学的如今依然适用。背后的原则不会变，不像物理学，50年和今天都不一样。如果你运用这些投资原则，找到好公司，好管理层，会产生好产品的公司，你可以从中学习并在未来再运用。同时你也会明白自己不擅长的领域是哪些。明白什么你应该放弃和明白你擅长什么同样重要。我没办法成为常胜将军。别人说，要怎么才能赢鲍比菲舍尔？总之别和他下象棋。我肯定玩不出鲍比菲舍尔这样的水平象棋，但是可以慢慢学习投资学并不断完善你的技巧，并明白自己不擅长什么领域

学生: 我的问题是关于初始投资者。他们总会面临资金不足的问题。你觉得对于初始投资者应该有什么策略去对应这个问题？这个策略是否和一个已经非常成功的投资者有区别？
Student: My question is about a starting investor. They always face cash flow problems. So, what should be the strategy for a starting investor to counter that? Is it any difference from a successful investor with a lot of money?

<br>

巴菲特: 当我开始的时候，我的（投资）想法比我的钱多太多了。当我（从哥伦比亚大学）毕业的时候我身上一共有9,800美金。那时的我很快就要结婚而且马上就会有小孩。所以说我有的钱远不够，虽然我有很多想法。我把几千家公司都分析了一遍，发现了不少让我兴奋的投资机会。现在的我们（伯克希尔哈撒韦）反而钱比想法多得多，所以财富这种事情总会改变的。年轻的投资者……在60年前，我的生活其实和现在一模一样的好，我也过得和现在一样快乐。投资的历程才是它的乐趣所在。那时的我未曾想过如果我有100万我会过得会有多好，在我有了100万的时候我也没想过如果有1000万会有多好。事实上，我一辈子都过得非常好。我从未担心过下一顿饭会从哪里来，我睡觉用的床会在哪里。每一天我都过得非常开心，做着我想做的事情。在我21岁时生活是如此，在今天来看也是如此。
Warren Buffett: When I started, I have way more ideas than money. I have 9,800 dollars when I got out of school and I was soon to get married and have children reasonably soon. So, I have very little money but I have lots of ideas. I just went through...look at thousands of companies and there are all kinds of things that stimulate me. Now we’ve got more money than ideas so it shifts all over the time. Young investors…I was having as good time 60 years ago, as I’m having now…I’m having a good time now as I had then. It’s the adventure where the fun is. I did not think to myself if I have a million dollars I’m going to be way better off than I had when I had 10,000 dollars, or if I have ten million I will be better off than 1 million. The truth is I’ve lived well all my life. I’ve never had to worry about where a meal was coming or what bed I would sleep in. I’m having fun every day, doing what I do. That was true when I was 21 and it’s true today.

Coca Cola 2013 Shareowners meeting 
Warren Buffett On Why He'll Never Sell a Share of Coke Stock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p1_5bZ8I4M&t=245s

<br>

可口可乐首席执行官 Muhtar Kent：您能否谈谈美国，我们如何准备应对经济贸易政策、赤字、税收改革等方面的挑战？
Coke CEO Muhtar Kent: Could you say a few words about the United States, how we're prepared for meeting the challenges ahead in terms of economic trade policies, deficit, tax reform?

<br>

沃伦巴菲特：我们总是会遇到问题。但是，在我看来，世界历史上最幸运的人，就是今天在美国出生的婴儿。想想 1790 年，我们这里有 400 万人，世界上有数亿人。我们并不聪明，我们甚至没有比其他人更努力地工作。但是我们有一个释放人类潜力和发展机会的系统，一个容纳大量生产力的市场系统规则，难以置信。你想想 200 年前的样子，这里基本上什么都没有，而这个系统在我一生的时间里，为大家的生活水平改进了5倍。所以我们已经有了公式，而且还没有任何停下的迹象。我们看看过去 15 年或 20 年发生了什么吧。我们不断培养出像史蒂夫·乔布斯这样的人，而且这种现象还会继续。
Warren Buffett: We always have problems. But, Muhtar, the luckiest person, on a probability basis, in my view, that's ever been born in the history of the world, is the baby being born the United States today. Just think about it in 1790, we had four million people here and there were hundreds of millions of people in the world. We weren't smarter and we didn't even work harder than other people are necessarily. But we had a system that unleashed human potential and that system -- quality of opportunity, a rule of a market system as produced in abundance, you can't believe I mean just just look about you think about what this looked like 200 years ago. There wasn't anything here basically and it improves the standard of living in my lifetime six for one. So we we've got the formula and it hasn't been exhausted remotely. Just look at what's happened in the last 15 or 20 years, we keep turning out people like Steve Jobs and that'll continue. 

<br>

我们总会遇到问题。 自从我离开学校后，我就开始卖股票。 人们总是给我十个你不应该买它们的理由。 你一生都听过它们，但世界不属于悲观主义者，相信我。 你在做空幸福。 将幸福留在身边是生活很重要的一步。我们有这样的经济系统。 这是有效的系统。 你只需要以极其勤奋的热情和不断的努力去前进
We'll always have problems. Ever since I got out of school, I used to sell stocks. People always give me ten reasons why you shouldn't buy them. You've heard them all throughout your life but the world does not belong to the pessimists, believe me. You're selling happiness. Having it at arm's length away is a big part of it. The distribution systems been developed. It's the right formula, Muhtar. It just has to be carried out with extreme diligence enthusiasm and every minute of the day

一般来说，给自己进行的投资是最好的事情。任何能提升你的才能的事情都可以，这样没有人能夺走你的优势。他们（国家政府）可以出现巨大的亏损，钞票可以大幅贬值。你可能会遭遇任何事情。但是如果你有才能并且尽可能将其发挥，这就是一种资产。这不代表每个人都需要去读大学，但是这意味这你要想尽一切办法去进步。沟通技巧极其重要。我以前上过戴尔·卡耐基的课，大概花了我几百美金，而它的价值相当于一个大学文凭。至少我是这么觉得的。
Warren Buffett: Generally speaking, investing in yourself is the best thing you can do. Anything that improves your talents, so nobody can take away from you. They can run up huge deficits and the dollar can be worth far less. You can have all kinds of things happen. But if you've got talent yourself and you maximize your talent, you've got a terrific asset. It doesn't mean everybody should go to college. But it does mean that anyway you find to improve. Communication skills are enormously important. I mean I took the Dale Carnegie course that might be a hundred dollars and it was worth a college degree. At least I thought it was.

https://buffett.cnbc.com/video/2016/02/29/buffett-name-me-one-super-wealthy-economist.html 

所有这些有160 IQ的经济学家，他们一生都在学习，你能说出一位曾经从证券中赚钱的超级富有的经济学家吗？
All of these economist 160 IQs to spend their life studying and can you name me one super wealthy economist that's ever made money out of securities? 

<br>

我们来一个个细数一下
Let me just go down the list now. 

<br>

实际上，凯恩斯早年曾试图通过预测商业行为来赚钱。 他放弃了。 然后他采用了格雷厄姆式的方法。 如果你阅读他在这方面的历史你会发现非常有趣，因为他认为他可以通过查看各种经济变量来择时投资他所谓的信贷周期，并从中赚到很多钱。他在这样做时破产了几次。他不得不向人们借钱，然后他决定以便宜的价格购买他理解的好企业，并集中投资，他做得很好。 这是一段有趣的历史。
Keynes actually in his early years tried to make money in stocks by predicting what business would do. He gave it up. Then he went over to a Graham type approach. It's very interesting to read his history on this because he thought he could by looking at various economic variables pick what he called the credit cycle and making a lot of money in. He broke a couple of times when doing it. He had to borrow from people and then he was settled on buying good businesses cheap that he understood and concentrating his investments and he did very well. It's an interesting history. 

<br>

如果你看看这些经济学家的生平，你就会知道他们在买卖股票时赚不了很多钱。 但是买卖股票的人都听他们的，这就是我有一点不太能理解的。
If you look at the whole history of them, you know they don't make a lot of money buying and selling stocks. But people who buy and sell stocks listen to them which is I have a little trouble.

Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder meeting

Morning Session - 1998 Meeting

[Link from CNBC](https://buffett.cnbc.com/video/1998/05/04/morning-session---1998-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting.html)

<br>

听众：我是来自加利福尼亚州洛杉矶的 Paul Yoon (PH)。沃伦·巴菲特先生，查尔斯·芒格先生，我是非常钦佩你们的人之一。我有两个问题。

AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Paul Yoon (PH) from L.A., California. Mr. Warren Buffett, Mr. Charles Munger, I am one of the persons who highly admire you both. I have two questions.

<br>

问题一：您对未来十年世界金融商业环境的看法。

Question one: your view on the world financial business environment in the next decade.

<br>

问题二——（笑声）——美国在未来十年的经济竞争中的立场。谢谢你。

Question two — (laughter) — U.S. position for economic competition in the next decade. Thank you.

<br>

沃伦·巴菲特：嗯，你问了两个大问题，但恐怕你会得到非常小的答案。 （笑声）这并不是不尊重你。但是我们不太会考虑这些事情。我们只是在寻找优质的企业。顺便说一句，我们过去在对经济的预测和看法对我们现在的投资结果不会有任何好处。

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, you’ve asked two big questions, but you’re going to get very small answers, I’m afraid. (Laughter) And that’s no disrespect. But we — we just — we don’t have that. We don’t think about those things very much. We just are looking for decent businesses. And incidentally, our views in the past wouldn’t have been any good on those subjects.

<br>

我们试着思考两件事。我们试图去思考重要的事情和可知的事情。现在有些重要的事情是不可知的。我们认为，你提出的这两个问题都属于这一点。有些事情是可知的但并不重要，对于这些我们不想把我们的思想弄得乱七八糟。

We try to think about two things. We try to think about things that are important and things that are knowable. Now, there are things that are important that are not knowable. In our view, those two questions that you raised fall in that. There are things that are knowable but not important. We don’t want to clutter our minds up with those.

<br>

所以我们会问自己“什么是重要的，什么是可知的？”我们可以将属于这两个类别的内容转化为对伯克希尔有用的行动。查理和我对于各种重要的主题实际上一无所知，因此我们不考虑它们。我们对未来十年世界在商业或竞争环境的预测和观点并不能做有效预测。

So we say, “What is important and what is knowable?” And what among the things that fall within those two categories can we translate into some kind of an action that is useful for Berkshire. And we really — there are all kinds of important subjects that Charlie and I, we don’t know anything about, and therefore we don’t think about them. So we have — our view about what the world will look like over the next ten years in business or competitive situations, we’re just no good.

<br>

但是我们确实认为我们知道可口可乐在十年后会是什么样子，或者吉列在十年后会是什么样子，或者迪士尼在十年后会是什么样子，或者我们的一些运营子公司会是什么样子十年后的样子。我们非常关心这一点。我们对此思考了很多。我们希望在这方面是正确的。如果我们在这点上是对的，那么其他事情就会变得不那么重要了。如果我们开始专注于这些不可预测的事情，我们会错过很多重要的事情。

We do think we know something about what Coca-Cola’s going to look like in ten years, or what Gillette’s going to look like in ten years, or what Disney’s going to look like in ten years, or what some of our operating subsidiaries are going to look like in ten years. We care a lot about that. We think a lot about that. We want to be right about that. If we’re right about that, the other things get to be — you know, they’re less important. And if we started focusing on those, we would miss a lot of big things.

<br>

我以前用过这个例子。可口可乐上市是在 1919 年。第一年每股的价格是 40 美元。第一年下降了50%多一点。到年底，它降至 19 美元。可口可乐和装瓶商合同存在一些问题，糖有问题，各种各样的问题。

I’ve used this example before, but Coca-Cola went public in, I think, it was 1919. And the first year one share cost $40. The first year it went down a little over 50 percent. At the end of the year, it was down to $19. There were some problems with bottler contracts. There’s problems with sugar. Various kinds of problems.

<br>

如果你有完美的远见，你就会看到世界上最严重的萧条等着你，严重到会动摇社会秩序。你会看到第二次世界大战紧随其后，然后你会看到原子弹和氢弹，你会看到各种各样的东西。

If you’d had perfect foresight, you would have seen the world’s greatest depression staring you in the face, when the social order even got questioned. You would have seen World War II. You would have seen atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. You would have seen all kinds of things.

<br>

你总能找到一个理由来推迟你应该购买那份可口可乐股票的理由。但重要的不是看到这一点。重要的是看到他们今年每天将销售 10 亿份 8 盎司的饮料。一个每天能让全世界的人们快乐十亿次的公司应该能从中赚到几块钱。

And you could always find a reason to postpone why you should buy that share of Coca-Cola. But the important thing wasn’t to see that. The important thing was to see they were going to be selling a billion eight-ounce servings of beverages a day this year. Or some large number. And that the person who could make people happy a billion times a day around the globe ought to make a few bucks off doing it.

<br>

因此，持有可口可乐的股票从40 美元下降到 19 美元，在股息再投资后，现在价值已经远远超过 500 万美元。如果你对这些其他的因素形成了观点，导致你阻止了你对可口可乐公司这种更重要、更具体的因素采取行动，你就会错失良机。所以公司的自身潜力是我们关注的事情。

And so that $40, which went down to $19, I think with dividends reinvested, has to be well over $5 million now. And if you developed a view on these other subjects that in any way forestalled you acting on this more important, specific narrow view about the future of the company, you would have missed a great ride. So that’s the kind of thing we focus on.

<br>

查理？

Charlie?

<br>

查理芒格：是的，我们并不会预测即将到来的浪潮，我们只是预测一些事物将如何在潮流中游泳。

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, we’re not predicting the currents that will come, just how some things will swim in the currents, whatever they are.

时间：2005年9月30日

地点：University Of Nebraska

<br>

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AlPTiJrJnE)

<br>

嗨，我是 Marisa Pont，我是高级管理专业的学生。 显然，作为公众，我们听到的最多的你们成功的投资（指巴菲特）或您开发的新产品（指比尔·盖茨）。 我只是想知道你认为你做过的最糟糕的投资是什么？（译者注：巴菲特和比尔盖茨都在现场）

Hi, I’m Marisa Pont I’m a senior management major. Obviously as a public what we hear most about are your successful investing adventures or the new products that you develop that work out. I was just wondering what is what would you consider to be the worst investment you've ever made?

<br>

沃伦巴菲特：我做过的最糟糕的投资？ 你有多久时间？ [笑声] 好吧，我做了一些非常糟糕的事情，但这并没有真正困扰我。 这可能会困扰我的股东，但这是另一个问题了。 你知道你会在生活中犯错。 但是毫无疑问你不想在重大决定上出错，比如和谁结婚，诸如此类的。

Warren Buffett: The worst investment I ever made? How long do you have? [Laughter] well I’ve made some very bad ones but that doesn't really bother me. It may bother the shareholders but that's another question. you know you're going to make mistakes in life. There's no question about it. You don't want to make them on the big decisions. You know who you marry and some things like that.

<br>

但是我不可能在不犯错误的情况下做出很多商业和投资决策。 我可能会尽量减少它们，但是我根本不会在错误上纠结。 我不沉溺过去。

There's no way I'm going to make a lot of business and investment decisions without making some mistakes. I may try to minimize them I don't dwell on them at all. I don't look back.

<br>

最大的错误是那些实际上没有被公开的错误。 它们是疏忽导致的，而不是执行导致的错误。 我们从来没有在任何一项投资上损失过那么多钱，但重大错误是那些我知道的足以去做但我没有做的事情。 在我知道要做的事情上，我没有行动，导致我们错失了多达 100 亿美元的利润。 我没有投资微软并不是一个错过的机会，因为我没有足够的见解来做出那个决定。 但是还有其他投资，我确实知道足以做出决定，但是出于某种原因，我要么根本不做，要么投资的规模很小。 我本该在写支票的时候却在吮吸拇指。

The biggest mistakes are the ones that actually don't show up. They're the mistakes of omission rather than commission. we've never lost that much money on any one investment, but it's the things that I knew enough to do that I didn't do. We have missed profits of as much as maybe 10 billion dollars in things that I knew enough to do. And I didn't do. Now the fact that I didn't buy Microsoft way back is not a foregone opportunity because I didn't know enough to make that decision. But there have been other investments where I did know enough to make the decision and for one reason or another I either didn't do it at all or I did it on a small scale. I was sucking my thumb when I should have been writing checks

<br>

这些错误没有公开过。 没有任何地方会显示我们的错失机会清单。 但我是错过了一些很有价值的机会。 生活中的胜利部分是胜利，因为你知道你不会在每一件事上都能做对。 我永远不会太沉迷于错误。 我认识很多人，他们真的为过去的错误而苦恼。 这不值得。 明天又是一天，你继续前进，然后继续下一件事情。

Those don't show up. There's no place where it shows “missed opportunities”. But I've missed some big ones. The triumphs in life are partly triumphs because you know that everything isn't going to be a triumph. I would never get too hung up on mistakes. I know a lot of people that really agonize over them. It just isn't worth it. Tomorrow is another day, and you live it forward and just go on to the next thing.
