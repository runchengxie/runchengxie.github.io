## 在一开始 In the Beginning

1964年5月6日，那时由Seabury Stanton先生领导的伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司向其股东发送了一份通知，提议以每股11.375美元的价格回购225,000股股票。我原本预期会收到这样的通知；但价格让我有些意外。

On May 6, 1964, Berkshire Hathaway, then run by a man named Seabury Stanton, sent a letter to its shareholders offering to buy 225,000 shares of its stock for $11.375 per share. I had expected the letter; I was surprised by the price.

<br>

伯克希尔当时有1,583,680股未流通股份。其中大约7%由我管理并投资了几乎所有净资产的巴菲特合伙有限公司（“BPL”）所持有。在要约信发出不久前，Stanton曾询问我BPL打算以什么价格出售其持股。我回答说11.50美元，他回应：“好的，我们达成协议了。”但随后伯克希尔的来信却降低了价格至少了八分之一点。这让我对Stanton的行为感到不满，因此我没有响应此要约。

Berkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett Partnership Ltd. (“BPL”), an investing entity that I managed and in which I had virtually all of my net worth. Shortly before the tender offer was mailed, Stanton had asked me at what price BPL would sell its holdings. I answered $11.50, and he said, “Fine, we have a deal.” Then came Berkshire’s letter, offering an eighth of a point less. I bristled at Stanton’s behavior and didn’t tender.

<br>

那实际上是一个非常糟糕的决定。

That was a monumentally stupid decision.

<br>

那时的伯克希尔是一家处于困境的北方纺织制造商。它所在的行业不仅名义上，而且实际上也在衰退中。而伯克希尔因为各种原因，未能及时调整方向。

Berkshire was then a northern textile manufacturer mired in a terrible business. The industry in which it operated was heading south, both metaphorically and physically. And Berkshire, for a variety of reasons, was unable to change course.

<br>

尽管这个行业的问题早已为人们所熟知，但情况仍然如此。1954年7月29日，伯克希尔的董事会记录清楚地列出了严酷的事实：“新英格兰的纺织业从四十年前就开始衰退。战争年代这一趋势得到了暂停。但这种趋势必须持续，直到供需达到平衡。”

That was true even though the industry’s problems had long been widely understood. Berkshire’s own Board minutes of July 29, 1954, laid out the grim facts: “The textile industry in New England started going out of business forty years ago. During the war years this trend was stopped. The trend must continue until supply and demand have been balanced.”

<br>

大约一年后的那次董事会后，拥有19世纪根基的伯克希尔精纺联合和哈撒韦制造公司携手合作，采用了我们今天的名字。凭借其十四家工厂和1万名员工，新合并的公司成为了新英格兰纺织业的巨擘。然而，两家公司的高层原本看做是合并协议的，很快就变成了灾难性的联盟。在合并后的七年里，伯克希尔一直处于整体亏损状态，其净资产缩水了37%。

About a year after that board meeting, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing — both with roots in the 19th Century — joined forces, taking the name we bear today. With its fourteen plants and 10,000 employees, the merged company became the giant of New England textiles. What the two managements viewed as a merger agreement, however, soon morphed into a suicide pact. During the seven years following the consolidation, Berkshire operated at an overall loss, and its net worth shrunk by 37%.

<br>

同时，该公司关闭了九家工厂，有时用清算所得来回购股份。这种情况引起了我的注意。

Meanwhile, the company closed nine plants, sometimes using the liquidation proceeds to repurchase shares. And that pattern caught my attention.

<br>

1962年12月，我购买了BPL的首批伯克希尔股票，预期还会有更多的关闭和回购。当时股票的售价只有7.50美元，远低于每股10.25美元的营运资本和20.20美元的账面价值。买这股票就像捡到一个被丢弃的雪茄烟蒂，上面还留有一口可以吸的烟。虽然烟蒂看起来破烂不堪、湿漉漉的，但那一口却是免费的。然而，一旦享受了那一刹那的愉悦，就别再期待更多了。

I purchased BPL’s first shares of Berkshire in December 1962, anticipating more closings and more repurchases. The stock was then selling for $7.50, a wide discount from per-share working capital of $10.25 and book value of $20.20. Buying the stock at that price was like picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puff remaining in it. Though the stub might be ugly and soggy, the puff would be free. Once that momentary pleasure was enjoyed, however, no more could be expected.

<br>

从那时起，伯克希尔紧紧地遵循了原定的脚本：很快又关闭了两家工厂，并在1964年5月用关闭的收益来回购股份。斯坦顿提供的价格比我们最初购买的成本高出50%。那它就在那里 —— 我那免费的一口气，就这样静静地等待着我，此后我可以在其他地方找寻更多被抛弃的烟蒂。

Berkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964 move, set out to repurchase shares with the shutdown proceeds. The price that Stanton offered was 50% above the cost of our original purchases. There it was — my free puff, just waiting for me, after which I could look elsewhere for other discarded butts.

<br>

然而，被斯坦顿的小气激怒后，我放弃了他的报价，开始大举购买更多的伯克希尔股份。

Instead, irritated by Stanton’s chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshire shares.

<br>

到1965年4月，BPL拥有392,633股（那时共有1,017,547股流通在外），而在五月初的董事会我们正式掌控了这家公司。通过西伯里和我那幼稚的行为 —— 毕竟，对我们两人来说这一点点分歧有什么大不了的呢？ —— 他失去了他的职位，我却发现自己将超过25%的BPL资本投资在一个我几乎一无所知的糟糕行业中。我仿佛成了那只追上了车的狗，却不知所措。

By April 1965, BPL owned 392,633 shares (out of 1,017,547 then outstanding) and at an early-May board meeting we formally took control of the company. Through Seabury’s and my childish behavior — after all, what was an eighth of a point to either of us? — he lost his job, and I found myself with more than 25% of BPL’s capital invested in a terrible business about which I knew very little. I became the dog who caught the car.

<br>

由于伯克希尔的运营损失和股票回购，到1964财年末其净值从1955年合并时的5500万美元降至2200万美元。这整整2200万美元都被纺织业务所占用：公司现金告罄，并且欠银行250万美元。（伯克希尔1964年的年度报告已在第130-142页上复制。）

Because of Berkshire’s operating losses and share repurchases, its net worth at the end of fiscal 1964 had fallen to $22 million from $55 million at the time of the 1955 merger. The full $22 million was required by the textile operation: The company had no excess cash and owed its bank $2.5 million. (Berkshire’s 1964 annual report is reproduced on pages 130-142.)

<br>

有段时间我算是走运了：伯克希尔立刻享受了两年的良好运营环境。更为幸运的是，在那几年里我们不需要缴纳所得税，因为我们有大量的亏损可以结转，这是前几年糟糕表现的结果。

For a time I got lucky: Berkshire immediately enjoyed two years of good operating conditions. Better yet, its earnings in those years were free of income tax because it possessed a large loss carry-forward that had arisen from the disastrous results in earlier years.

<br>

然而好景不长。自1966年起的18年里，我们持续不断地与纺织业务进行斗争，但都无济于事。但固执——或者说愚蠢？——也是有限度的。到了1985年，我终于认输了，并关闭了该业务。

Then the honeymoon ended. During the 18 years following 1966, we struggled unremittingly with the textile business, all to no avail. But stubbornness — stupidity? — has its limits. In 1985, I finally threw in the towel and closed the operation.

************

<br>

不受我首次将BPL的大部分资源投入到一个即将消亡的业务的错误影响，我迅速加剧了这个错误。确实，我的第二次错误比第一次更为严重，最终成为我职业生涯中代价最高的失误。

Undeterred by my first mistake of committing much of BPL’s resources to a dying business, I quickly compounded the error. Indeed, my second blunder was far more serious than the first, eventually becoming the most costly in my career.

<br>

在1967年初，我指示伯克希尔花费860万美元购买了国家赔偿公司（“NICO”），这是一家规模不大但颇具潜力的奥马哈基础保险公司。（交易还包括了一个小型的姊妹公司。）保险业是我的舒适区：我深刻理解并热衷于这个行业。

Early in 1967, I had Berkshire pay $8.6 million to buy National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a small but promising Omaha-based insurer. (A tiny sister company was also included in the deal.) Insurance was in my sweet spot: I understood and liked the industry.

<br>

Jack Ringwalt是NICO的老板，也是我的多年朋友，他想卖给我——确切的说，卖给我个人。他从没有打算把它卖给伯克希尔。那么，我为何选择用伯克希尔而非BPL来购买NICO呢？对于这个问题，我已经思考了48年，但仍然没有一个合理的答案。我只是犯了一个巨大的错误。

Jack Ringwalt, the owner of NICO, was a long-time friend who wanted to sell to me — me, personally. In no way was his offer intended for Berkshire. So why did I purchase NICO for Berkshire rather than for BPL? I’ve had 48 years to think about that question, and I’ve yet to come up with a good answer. I simply made a colossal mistake.

<br>

如果BPL是购买方，我和我的合伙人本可以完全拥有一家优秀的企业，它本应是构建伯克希尔成为今天这样规模的基石。更进一步，我们的成长不会被纺织业务中那些未产生效益的资金所拖累将近二十年。最终，我们随后的收购将完全由我和我的合伙人所拥有，而不是被伯克希尔的原股东所持有39%，我们并不对他们承担任何义务。尽管这些明显的事实就在我面前，我还是选择了将一个优良业务（NICO）的全部和一个糟糕业务（伯克希尔哈撒韦）的61%结合，这一决定最终导致大约1万亿美元从BPL的合伙人转移到了一群陌生人手中。

If BPL had been the purchaser, my partners and I would have owned 100% of a fine business, destined to form the base for building the company Berkshire has become. Moreover, our growth would not have been impeded for nearly two decades by the unproductive funds imprisoned in the textile operation. Finally, our subsequent acquisitions would have been owned in their entirety by my partners and me rather than being 39%-owned by the legacy shareholders of Berkshire, to whom we had no obligation. Despite these facts staring me in the face, I opted to marry 100% of an excellent business (NICO) to a 61%-owned terrible business (Berkshire Hathaway), a decision that eventually diverted $100 billion or so from BPL partners to a collection of strangers.

************

<br>

再多坦白一件事然后我将转向更加愉快的话题：你能相信在1975年我竟然购买了Waumbec Mills，另一家新英格兰的纺织公司吗？当然，从我们收到的资产和与伯克希尔原有纺织业务预期的协同效应来看，购买价格确实是个“便宜货”。但是——你猜怎么着——Waumbec成为了一个灾难，没过几年，这家工厂就被迫关闭了。

One more confession and then I’ll go on to more pleasant topics: Can you believe that in 1975 I bought Waumbec Mills, another New England textile company? Of course, the purchase price was a “bargain” based on the assets we received and the projected synergies with Berkshire’s existing textile business. Nevertheless — surprise, surprise — Waumbec was a disaster, with the mill having to be closed down not many years later.

<br>

现在来报告些好消息：北部的纺织行业终于消失了。如果你听说我被看到在新英格兰徘徊，你就不必再惊慌了。

And now some good news: The northern textile industry is finally extinct. You need no longer panic if you hear that I’ve been spotted wandering around New England.

## 查理给我指明方向 Charlie Straightens Me Out

当我管理着微薄资金时，我的“雪茄蒂”投资策略表现得非常出色。实际上，上世纪五十年代，我获得了许多免费的机会，这使得那个十年成为了我绝对和相对投资表现最佳的时期。

My cigar-butt strategy worked very well while I was managing small sums. Indeed, the many dozens of free puffs I obtained in the 1950s made that decade by far the best of my life for both relative and absolute investment performance.

<br>

然而，即便在那个时候，我也有一些例外，其中最重要的就是GEICO。多亏了我在1951年与洛里默·戴维森（Lorimer Davidson）进行的一次交谈。这位后来成为该公司首席执行官的出色人才让我了解到，GEICO是一家了不起的企业，于是我立刻将我的净资产的65%投入到了它的股票中。然而，那些早期年份的大部分收益都来自于那些以低价交易的中等水平公司的投资。本·格雷厄姆（Ben Graham）教给了我这一技巧，而它确实有效。

Even then, however, I made a few exceptions to cigar butts, the most important being GEICO. Thanks to a 1951 conversation I had with Lorimer Davidson, a wonderful man who later became CEO of the company, I learned that GEICO was a terrific business and promptly put 65% of my $9,800 net worth into its shares. Most of my gains in those early years, though, came from investments in mediocre companies that traded at bargain prices. Ben Graham had taught me that technique, and it worked.

<br>

然而，这种策略的一个主要弱点逐渐显现出来：雪茄蒂投资策略只在某个程度上可扩展。对于大笔资金，这种策略将永远无法表现良好。

But a major weakness in this approach gradually became apparent: Cigar-butt investing was scalable only to a point. With large sums, it would never work well.

<br>

此外，尽管以低价购买的边际企业可能在短期内吸引人，但它们不是建立一个大而持久企业的正确基础。选择结婚伙伴明显需要比约会更为严格的标准。（值得注意的是，伯克希尔哈撒韦（Berkshire Hathaway）可能是一个非常理想的“约会对象”：如果我们接受了西伯利·斯坦顿（Seabury Stanton）以11.375美元的价格购买我们的股份的提议，那么伯克希尔哈撒韦对其投资的年化加权回报率将达到约40%。）

In addition, though marginal businesses purchased at cheap prices may be attractive as short-term investments, they are the wrong foundation on which to build a large and enduring enterprise. Selecting a marriage partner clearly requires more demanding criteria than does dating. (Berkshire, it should be noted, would have been a highly satisfactory “date”: If we had taken Seabury Stanton’s $11.375 offer for our shares, BPL’s weighted annual return on its Berkshire investment would have been about 40%.)

************

<br>

需要查理·芒格才能打破我的雪茄蒂投资习惯，为建立一个规模庞大但获得令人满意利润的企业制定方向。查理就在我现在居住的地方几百英尺处长大，年轻时曾像我一样在我祖父的杂货店工作。然而，直到1959年，我才第一次见到查理，那时他已经离开奥马哈，定居洛杉矶。我当时28岁，而他35岁。介绍我们认识的奥马哈医生曾预言我们会合得来，事实证明他说得对。

It took Charlie Munger to break my cigar-butt habits and set the course for building a business that could combine huge size with satisfactory profits. Charlie had grown up a few hundred feet from where I now live and as a youth had worked, as did I, in my grandfather’s grocery store. Nevertheless, it was 1959 before I met Charlie, long after he had left Omaha to make Los Angeles his home. I was then 28 and he was 35. The Omaha doctor who introduced us predicted that we would hit it off — and we did.

<br>

如果你们参加过我们的年度股东大会，你们就知道查理拥有广泛的才智、惊人的记忆力，还有一些坚定的观点。我自己也不是个优柔寡断的人，我们有时候意见不合。然而，56年来，我们从未发生过争执。当我们有分歧时，查理通常会结束对话，说：“沃伦，好好考虑一下，你会同意我的，因为你很聪明，而我是正确的。”

If you’ve attended our annual meetings, you know Charlie has a wide-ranging brilliance, a prodigious memory, and some firm opinions. I’m not exactly wishy-washy myself, and we sometimes don’t agree. In 56 years, however, we’ve never had an argument. When we differ, Charlie usually ends the conversation by saying: “Warren, think it over and you’ll agree with me because you’re smart and I’m right.”

<br>

大多数人不知道的是，查理对建筑有着浓厚的兴趣。尽管他开始职业生涯是执业律师（计时费用为每小时15美元），但在30多岁时，查理通过设计和建造洛杉矶附近的五个公寓项目第一次赚到了真正的钱。与此同时，他设计了他今天住的房子，已经有55年了。（和我一样，如果他身处喜欢的环境中，查理也是不可动摇的。）近年来，查理还设计了斯坦福大学和密歇根大学的大型宿舍综合体，而现在，已经91岁的他正在进行另一个重大项目的设计。

What most of you do not know about Charlie is that architecture is among his passions. Though he began his career as a practicing lawyer (with his time billed at $15 per hour), Charlie made his first real money in his 30s by designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that he lives in today — some 55 years later. (Like me, Charlie can’t be budged if he is happy in his surroundings.) In recent years, Charlie has designed large dorm complexes at Stanford and the University of Michigan and today, at age 91, is working on another major project.

<br>

从我的角度来看，查理最重要的建筑壮举是设计今天的伯克希尔。他给我的蓝图很简单：忘记你知道的以美妙的价格购买普通企业的方式，取而代之的是，以公平的价格购买出色企业。

From my perspective, though, Charlie’s most important architectural feat was the design of today’s Berkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.

<br>

改变我的行为并非易事（问问我的家人就知道了）。在没有查理的建议之前，我已经取得了一些合理的成功，那么为什么要听一个从未在商学院待过一天的律师（咳咳，我则已经上了三个学期）呢？但查理从未厌倦地向我重复他关于商业和投资的格言，而他的逻辑是无可辩驳的。因此，伯克希尔是按照查理的蓝图建立起来的。我的角色就像总承包商，伯克希尔子公司的首席执行官才是实际工作的分包商。

Altering my behavior is not an easy task (ask my family). I had enjoyed reasonable success without Charlie’s input, so why should I listen to a lawyer who had never spent a day in business school (when — ahem — I had attended three). But Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and his logic was irrefutable. Consequently, Berkshire has been built to Charlie’s blueprint. My role has been that of general contractor, with the CEOs of Berkshire’s subsidiaries doing the real work as sub-contractors.

<br>

1972年对伯克希尔来说是一个转折点（尽管在我方面偶尔会有一些倒退，记得我在1975年购买Waumbec吗）。那时，我们有机会以蓝筹股票（Blue Chip Stamps）的名义购买See's Candy，这家公司是查理、我和伯克希尔都持有大量股份的公司，后来并入了伯克希尔。

The year 1972 was a turning point for Berkshire (though not without occasional backsliding on my part — remember my 1975 purchase of Waumbec). We had the opportunity then to buy See’s Candy for Blue Chip Stamps, a company in which Charlie, I and Berkshire had major stakes, and which was later merged into Berkshire.

<br>

See's是一家传奇的西海岸巧克力制造和零售商，当时每年实现税前约400万美元的利润，只利用了800万美元的净有形资产。此外，公司拥有一项在资产负债表上没有显示的巨大优势：广泛而持久的竞争优势，赋予了它重要的定价权。这种优势几乎可以肯定地使See's在未来的时间里获得重大的盈利。更好的是，这些盈利将只需进行少量增量投资就能实现。换句话说，See's可以预期未来几十年都会产生大量现金流。

See’s was a legendary West Coast manufacturer and retailer of boxed chocolates, then annually earning about $4 million pre-tax while utilizing only $8 million of net tangible assets. Moreover, the company had a huge asset that did not appear on its balance sheet: a broad and durable competitive advantage that gave it significant pricing power. That strength was virtually certain to give See’s major gains in earnings over time. Better yet, these would materialize with only minor amounts of incremental investment. In other words, See’s could be expected to gush cash for decades to come.

<br>

控制See's的家族希望以3000万美元出售该业务，查理说它值那么多是正确的。但我不想支付超过2500万美元，即使在那个数字上也不是特别热衷。（三倍净有形资产的价格让我感到有点吃惊。）我的谨慎可能会破坏一次绝佳的收购。但幸运的是，卖方决定接受我们2500万美元的报价。

The family controlling See’s wanted $30 million for the business, and Charlie rightly said it was worth that much. But I didn’t want to pay more than $25 million and wasn’t all that enthusiastic even at that figure. (A price that was three times net tangible assets made me gulp.) My misguided caution could have scuttled a terrific purchase. But, luckily, the sellers decided to take our $25 million bid.

<br>

至今，See's公司税前赚取了190亿美元，而这一增长仅需要额外投资4000万美元。西兹公司因此能够分配巨额资金，用以协助伯克希尔购并其他企业，这些企业进而创造了可观的可分配利润（可视为兔子的繁殖过程）。此外，透过观察西兹公司的运营，我获得了一份关于强大品牌价值的商业教育，这打开了我对许多其他有利可图投资的眼界。

To date, See’s has earned $1.9 billion pre-tax, with its growth having required added investment of only $40 million. See’s has thus been able to distribute huge sums that have helped Berkshire buy other businesses that, in turn, have themselves produced large distributable profits. (Envision rabbits breeding.) Additionally, through watching See’s in action, I gained a business education about the value of powerful brands that opened my eyes to many other profitable investments.

************

即便有了查理的蓝图，自Waumbec以来，我也犯了不少错误，其中最严重的是德克斯特鞋业。1993年我们收购了这家公司，当时它的业绩相当出色，绝不像一家“雪茄蒂”公司。然而，由于外国竞争的崛起，它的竞争优势迅速蒸发，而我却未能看到这一点。

Even with Charlie’s blueprint, I have made plenty of mistakes since Waumbec. The most gruesome was Dexter Shoe. When we purchased the company in 1993, it had a terrific record and in no way looked to me like a cigar butt. Its competitive strengths, however, were soon to evaporate because of foreign competition. And I simply didn’t see that coming.

<br>

因此，伯克希尔以43.3亿美元购得德克斯特，然而其价值很快便一落千丈。然而，根据通用会计准则，无法准确反映我的错误之重大。事实上，我向德克斯特的出售方提供了伯克希尔的股票，而我用于交易的股票现在价值约57亿美元。从财务灾难的角度看，这次错误堪称吉尼斯世界纪录的奇迹。

Consequently, Berkshire paid $433 million for Dexter and, rather promptly, its value went to zero. GAAP accounting, however, doesn’t come close to recording the magnitude of my error. The fact is that I gave Berkshire stock to the sellers of Dexter rather than cash, and the shares I used for the purchase are now worth about $5.7 billion. As a financial disaster, this one deserves a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.

<br>

我随后的一些错误也包括使用伯克希尔的股票购买那些注定无法实现增长的企业。这类错误是致命的。以一家卓越企业的股票 - 伯克希尔绝对属于此类企业 - 来换取一家普通企业的所有权将不可逆地损害价值。

Several of my subsequent errors also involved the use of Berkshire shares to purchase businesses whose earnings were destined to simply limp along. Mistakes of that kind are deadly. Trading shares of a wonderful business — which Berkshire most certainly is — for ownership of a so-so business irreparably destroys value.

<br>

在我们持有的公司犯下这种错误时，我们也遭受了财务损失（有时我还担任董事职务）。太多时候，CEO们似乎对一个基本的现实视而不见：在一项并购中，你用股票支付的内在价值不应该大于你获得的企业的内在价值。

We’ve also suffered financially when this mistake has been committed by companies whose shares Berkshire has owned (with the errors sometimes occurring while I was serving as a director). Too often CEOs seem blind to an elementary reality: The intrinsic value of the shares you give in an acquisition must not be greater than the intrinsic value of the business you receive.

<br>

我从未见过一位投资银行家在向潜在收购方董事会提出股权交易时量化这一极其重要的数学关系。相反，银行家的关注点往往在于描述当前用于并购的“惯例”市价溢价，这种评估并购吸引力的方式绝对是愚蠢的，或者交易是否将提高收购方的每股盈利（这本身不应该是决定性因素）。为了实现所需的每股数字，气喘吁吁的CEO和他的“助手”们经常会虚构出奇想的“协同效应”。（作为多年来19家公司的董事，我从未听说过“非协同效应”的提及，尽管我见证了交易完成后大量的这种情况。）美国董事会会议室中很少有对并购的事后总结，其中实际情况诚实地与最初的预测进行比较。它们应该成为标准做法。

I’ve yet to see an investment banker quantify this all-important math when he is presenting a stock-for-stock deal to the board of a potential acquirer. Instead, the banker’s focus will be on describing “customary” premiums-to-market-price that are currently being paid for acquisitions — an absolutely asinine way to evaluate the attractiveness of an acquisition — or whether the deal will increase the acquirer’s earnings-per-share (which in itself should be far from determinative). In striving to achieve the desired per-share number, a panting CEO and his “helpers” will often conjure up fanciful “synergies.” (As a director of 19 companies over the years, I’ve never heard “dis-synergies” mentioned, though I’ve witnessed plenty of these once deals have closed.) Post mortems of acquisitions, in which reality is honestly compared to the original projections, are rare in American boardrooms. They should instead be standard practice.

<br>

我向您保证，即使在我离开后的很长时间里，伯克希尔的CEO和董事会在发行股份进行任何收购之前都会仔细进行内在价值计算。即使您的顾问向您推荐了一份昂贵的“公允性”意见支持这种交易，您也不可能通过用一张百元钞票交换八张十元钞票而致富。

I can promise you that long after I’m gone, Berkshire’s CEO and Board will carefully make intrinsic value calculations before issuing shares in any acquisitions. You can’t get rich trading a hundred-dollar bill for eight tens (even if your advisor has handed you an expensive “fairness” opinion endorsing that swap).

************

<br>

总体而言，伯克希尔的收购表现得非常出色，尤其是在一些大规模收购案例中。同样，我们在可交易证券方面的投资也表现不俗。后者始终以其市场价格计值，因此任何收益，包括未实现的收益，都会立即反映在我们的净值中。但是，我们完全拥有的企业永远不会在我们的资产负债表上被重新升值，即使我们可以以数十亿美元以上的价格出售它们，高于其账面价值。伯克希尔子公司价值的未记录增长已经巨大，尤其在过去十年中增长迅猛。

Overall, Berkshire’s acquisitions have worked out well — and very well in the case of a few large ones. So, too, have our investments in marketable securities. The latter are always valued on our balance sheet at their market prices so any gains — including those unrealized — are immediately reflected in our net worth. But the businesses we buy outright are never revalued upward on our balance sheet, even when we could sell them for many billions of dollars more than their carrying value. The unrecorded gains in the value of Berkshire’s subsidiaries have become huge, with these growing at a particularly fast pace in the last decade.

<br>

倾听查理的建议确实带来了回报。

Listening to Charlie has paid off.
