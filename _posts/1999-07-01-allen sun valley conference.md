我想谈谈股市，他（巴菲特）说。我将讨论如何定价股票，但我不会讨论它们在下个月或明年的走势。估值与预测不同。

I would like to talk about the stock market, he (Buffett) said. I will be talking about pricing stocks, but I will not be talking about predicting their course of action next month or next year. Valuing is not the same as predicting.

“在短期内，市场是一台投票机。在长期内，它是一台称重机。重量最终会起作用。但是投票在短期内也有影响。而且这是一种非常不民主的投票方式。不幸的是，他们没有设立任何文化测试来限制投票资格，正如你们所了解的那样。”

“In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it is a weighing machine. Weight counts eventually. But votes count in the short term. And it is a very undemocratic way of voting. Unfortunately, they have no literacy tests in terms of voting qualification, as you have all learned.”

在这17年里，经济规模增长了五倍多。[^1]财富五百强公司的销售额也增长了五倍多。然而，在这17年里，股市却毫无起色。”

During these 17 years, the size of the economy grew more than fivefold. The sales of the Fortune Five Hundred companies grew more than fivefold. Yet, during these seventeen years, the stock market went exactly nowhere.”

[^1]: 《财富》杂志根据销售额对最大的500家公司进行排名，并称之为“财富500强”。这一组公司可以粗略地代表美国的商业。Fortune magazine ranks the largest 500 companies based on sales and refers to them as the Fortune 500.” This group of companies can be used as a rough proxy for U.S. –based business.

他后退了一两步。“你投资时所做的就是推迟消费，现在拿出钱来，以后得到更多的钱。其实只有两个问题。一个是你能拿回多少钱，另一个是什么时候。”

He backed up a step or two. “What you are doing when you invest is deferring consumption and laying money out now to get more money back at a later time. And there are really only two questions. One is how much you are going to get back and the other if when.

<br>

现在。伊索并不是一个很懂金融的人，因为他说过类似这样的话：“手中的一只鸟胜过林中的两只鸟。”但他没有说什么时候。”它们对金融来说就像重力对物理学一样。随着利率的变化，所有金融资产——房屋、股票、债券——的价值也会变化，就好像鸟的价格也有波动一样。“这就是为什么有时候手中的一只鸟比林中的两只鸟好，有时候林中的两只鸟比手中的一只鸟好。”

Now. Aesop was not much of a finance major, because he said something like, ‘A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.’ But he doesn’t say when.” They are to finance as gravity is to physics. As interest rates vary, the value of all financial assets—houses, stocks, bonds—changes, as if the price of birds had fluctuated. “And that is why sometimes a bird in the hand is better than two birds in the bush and sometimes two in the bush are better than one in the hand.”

<br>

巴菲特把伊索寓言与20世纪90年代的大牛市联系起来，他称之为胡说八道。利润增长远远低于之前的时期，但是因为利率低，树上的鸟儿很贵。很少有人想要现金——手里的鸟儿——因为利率太低了。所以投资者们为那些树上的鸟儿付出了前所未有的高价。巴菲特随意地把这称为“贪婪因素”。

Buffett related Aesop to the great bull market of 1990s, which he described as baloney. Profits had grown much less than in that previous period, but birds in the bush were expensive because interest rates were low. Fewer people wanted cash –the bird in the hand—at such low rates. So investors were paying unheard of price for those birds in the bush. Casually, Buffett referred to this as the “greed factor.”

巴菲特继续说：“股市每年以10%或更高的速度上涨，只有三种可能。一种是利率下降并保持在历史水平以下。第二种是投资者所占经济的份额，相对于雇员、政府和其他事物，超过了其已经历史性地高的水平。”[^2]或者，他说，经济可以开始比正常速度增长得更快。[^3]他称这种使用乐观假设的做法为“一厢情愿”。有些人，他说，并不认为整个市场会繁荣。他们只是相信自己能从其他人中挑出赢家。他像一个指挥家一样挥舞着胳膊，一边解释说，尽管创新可能会让世界摆脱贫困，但是历史上投资创新的人后来并不高兴，一边成功地放上了另一张幻灯片。

Buffett continued, “There were only three ways the stock market could keep raising at ten percent or more a year. One was if interest rates fell and remained below historic levels. The second was if the share of the economy that went to investors, as opposed to employees and government and other thing, rose above its already historically high level.” Or, he said, the economy could start growing faster than normal. He called it “wishful thinking” to use optimistic assumptions like these. Some people, he said, were not thinking that the whole market would flourish. They just believed they could pick the winners from the rest. Swinging his arms like an orchestra conductor, he succeeded in putting up another slide while explaining that, although innovation might lift the world out of poverty, people who invest in innovation historically have not been glad afterward.

[^2]: 当时，企业利润占国内生产总值的6%以上，而长期平均水平为4.88%。从那以后，它们已经上升到9%以上，远远高于历史水平。Corporate profits at the time were more than 6% of GDP, compared to a long-term average of 4.88%. They have since risen to over 9%, far above historic levels.

[^3]: 长期来看，美国经济以3%的实际增长率和5%的名义增长率（扣除通货膨胀）增长。除了战后的繁荣或从严重衰退中恢复之外，这个水平很少被超越。Over long periods the U.S. economy has grown at a real rate of 3% and a nominal rate (after inflation) of 5%. Other than a postwar boom or recovery from severe recession, this level is rarely exceeded.

这是一份长达七十页的美国汽车公司名单中的一半。”他挥舞着完整的名单。4“有两千家汽车公司：这可能是二十世纪上半叶最重要的发明。它对人们的生活产生了巨大的影响。如果你在第一辆汽车出现的时候看到了这个国家与汽车有关的发展，你会说，‘这是我必须去的地方。’但是，在两千家公司中，截至几年前，只有三家汽车公司幸存下来。而且，在某个时候，这三家公司都曾经低于账面价值，也就是投入到公司并留在那里的钱的数量。所以，汽车对美国产生了巨大的影响，但对投资者却产生了相反的影响。”以下是通用汽车（GM）、福特（F）和道琼斯工业平均指数（DJIA）的图表。注意福特和通用汽车与道琼斯工业平均指数相比的大幅低于平均水平。

This is half of a page which comes from a list seventy pages long of all the auto companies in the United States.” He waved the complete list in the air.4 “There were two thousand auto companies: the most important invention, probably, of the first half of the twentieth century. It had enormous impact on people’s lives. If you had seen at the time of the first car how this country would develop in connection with autos you would have said, ‘This is the place I must be.’ But of the two thousand companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived. And, at one time or the other, all three were selling for less than book value, which is the amount of money that had been put into the companies and left there. So autos had an enormous impact on America, but in the opposite direction on investors.” Below is a chart of General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and the DJIA. Note the massive under-performance of Ford and GM as compared to the DJIA.

但是，有时候，找出输家要容易得多。我想，那时候有一个显而易见的决定。当然，你应该做的事情就是做空马匹。”

But, sometimes it is much easier to figure out the losers. There was, I think, one obvious decision back then. And of course, the thing you should have been doing was shorting horses.”

| U.S. Horse Population |
|-----------------------|
| 1900                  | 17 million |
| 1998                  | 5 million  |

“坦白地说，我有点失望，巴菲特家族在这段时间里没有做空马匹。总有输家。”

“Frankly, I’m kind of disappointed that the Buffett family was not shorting horses throughout this entire period. There are always losers.”
