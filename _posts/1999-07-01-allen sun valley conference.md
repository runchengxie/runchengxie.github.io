我想谈谈股市，他（巴菲特）说。我将讨论如何定价股票，但我不会讨论它们在下个月或明年的走势。估值与预测不同。

I would like to talk about the stock market, he (Buffett) said. I will be talking about pricing stocks, but I will not be talking about predicting their course of action next month or next year. Valuing is not the same as predicting.

“在短期内，市场是一台投票机。在长期内，它是一台称重机。重量最终会起作用。但是投票在短期内也有影响。而且这是一种非常不民主的投票方式。不幸的是，他们没有设立任何文化测试来限制投票资格，正如你们所了解的那样。”

“In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it is a weighing machine. Weight counts eventually. But votes count in the short term. And it is a very undemocratic way of voting. Unfortunately, they have no literacy tests in terms of voting qualification, as you have all learned.”

在这17年里，经济规模增长了五倍多。财富五百强公司的销售额也增长了五倍多。然而，在这17年里，股市却毫无起色。”

During these 17 years, the size of the economy grew more than fivefold. The sales of the Fortune Five Hundred companies grew more than fivefold.[^1] Yet, during these seventeen years, the stock market went exactly nowhere.”

[^1]: 《财富》杂志根据销售额对最大的500家公司进行排名，并称之为“财富500强”。这一组公司可以粗略地代表美国的商业。Fortune magazine ranks the largest 500 companies based on sales and refers to them as the Fortune 500.” This group of companies can be used as a rough proxy for U.S. –based business.

他后退了一两步。“你投资时所做的就是推迟消费，现在拿出钱来，以后得到更多的钱。其实只有两个问题。一个是你能拿回多少钱，另一个是什么时候。”

He backed up a step or two. “What you are doing when you invest is deferring consumption and laying money out now to get more money back at a later time. And there are really only two questions. One is how much you are going to get back and the other if when.

现在。伊索并不是一个很懂金融的人，因为他说过类似这样的话：“手中的一只鸟胜过林中的两只鸟。”但他没有说什么时候。”它们对金融来说就像重力对物理学一样。随着利率的变化，所有金融资产——房屋、股票、债券——的价值也会变化，就好像鸟的价格也有波动一样。“这就是为什么有时候手中的一只鸟比林中的两只鸟好，有时候林中的两只鸟比手中的一只鸟好。”

Now. Aesop was not much of a finance major, because he said something like, ‘A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.’ But he doesn’t say when.” They are to finance as gravity is to physics. As interest rates vary, the value of all financial assets—houses, stocks, bonds—changes, as if the price of birds had fluctuated. “And that is why sometimes a bird in the hand is better than two birds in the bush and sometimes two in the bush are better than one in the hand.”
