巴菲特穿着他最喜欢的内布拉斯加红色毛衣，外套一件格子衬衫，和克拉克一起站在讲台上。他把故事讲完了。[^1]

Buffett joined Clarke at the podium, wearing his favorite Nebraska red sweater over a plaid shirt. He finished the story.

<br>

“科夫（Keough）一家是很棒的邻居，”他说。“确实有时候唐（Don）会提到，他和我不一样，他有一份工作，但我们的关系很好。有一次，我的妻子苏西（Susie）过去借了一杯糖，就像中西部人常做的那样，而唐的妻子米基（Mickie）给了她一整袋。当我听说这件事时，我决定那天晚上也去科夫家。我对唐说，‘你为什么不给我两万五千美元，让我为合伙人投资呢？’科夫一家在那时有点紧张，我被拒绝了。”

“The Keoughs were wonderful neighbors,” he said. “It’s true that occasionally Don would mention that, unlike me, he had a job, but the relationship was terrific. One time my wife, Susie, went over and did the proverbial Midwestern bit of asking to borrow a cup of sugar, and Don’s wife, Mickie, gave her a whole sack. When I heard about that, I decided to go over to the Keoughs’ that night myself. I said to Don, ‘Why don’t you give me twenty-five thousand dollars for the partnership to invest?’ And the Keough family stiffened a little bit at that point, and I was rejected.

<br>

“我后来又回来，要求克拉克提到的一万美元，结果也是一样。但我并不自豪。所以我又过了一段时间，要求五千美元。到了那时，我又被拒绝了。”

“I came back sometime later and asked for the ten thousand dollars Clarke referred to and got a similar result. But I wasn’t proud. So I returned at a later time and asked for five thousand dollars. And at that point, I got rejected again.

<br>

“所以有一天晚上，1962年夏天，我开始朝着基奥家走去。我不知道我会不会把价格降到两千五百美元，但是当我到了基奥家的时候，整个地方都是黑暗的，寂静无声。看不到任何东西。但我知道发生了什么。我知道唐和米基正在楼上躲着，所以我没有离开。”

“So one night, in the summer of 1962, I started heading over to the Keough house. I don’t know whether I would have dropped it to twenty-five hundred dollars or not, but by the time I got to the Keough household, the whole place was dark, silent. There wasn’t a thing to see. But I knew what was going on. I knew that Don and Mickie were hiding upstairs, so I didn’t leave.

<br>

“我按了门铃。我敲了敲门。没人应。但是唐和米基在楼上，而且一片漆黑。”

“I rang that doorbell. I knocked. Nothing happened. But Don and Mickie were upstairs, and it was pitch-black.

<br>

“太黑了，看不清楚。太早了，没到睡觉的时候。我记得那一天就像昨天一样。那是1962年6月21日。”

“Too dark to read, and too early to go to sleep. And I remember that day as if it were yesterday. That was June twenty-first, 1962.

<br>

“克拉克，你什么时候出生的？”

“Clarke, when were you born?”

<br>

“1963年3月21日。”

“March twenty-first, 1963.”

<br>

“就是这样的小事，历史才会因此改变。所以你应该庆幸他们没有给我一万美元。”

“It’s little things like that that history turns on. So you should be glad they didn’t give me the ten thousand dollars.”

<br>

在用这个小小的互动吸引了观众的注意后，巴菲特转向了手头的事情。“现在，我要尝试一下多任务处理。赫伯（Herb）让我加入了几张幻灯片。‘要跟上时代，’他说。在巴菲特家里，赫伯说的话就像是一条命令。”他故意忽略了“巴菲特家庭”到底包括了什么——因为巴菲特认为他的家庭就像其他普通家庭一样——他开始讲了一个关于艾伦（Allen）的笑话。美国总统的秘书匆匆跑进椭圆形办公室，为不小心安排了两个同时进行的会议而道歉。总统必须在见教皇和见赫伯特·艾伦之间做出选择。巴菲特停顿了一下，制造效果。“‘让教皇进来，’总统说。‘至少我只需要亲他的戒指。’”

Having charmed the audience with this little piece of give and take, Buffett turned to the matter at hand. “Now, I’m going to attempt to multitask today. Herb told me to include a few slides. ‘Show you’re with it,’ he said. When Herb says something, it’s practically an order in the Buffett household.” Speeding past exactly what comprised “the Buffett household”—for Buffett thought of his household as being like any other family’s—he launched into a joke about Allen. The secretary to the President of the U.S. rushed into the Oval Office, apologizing for accidentally scheduling two meetings at once. The President had to choose between seeing the Pope and seeing Herbert Allen. Buffett paused for effect. “ ‘Send in the Pope,’ said the President. ‘At least I only have to kiss his ring.’

<br>

“各位亲爱的戒指亲吻者，今天我想跟你们谈谈股市，”他说。“我将讨论如何定价股票，但我不会讨论预测它们下个月或明年的走势。估值和预测不是一回事。”

“To all you fellow ring-kissers, I would like to talk today about the stock market,” he said. “I will be talking about pricing stocks, but I will not be talking about predicting their course of action next month or next year. Valuing is not the same as predicting.

“短期来看，市场就像是投票机。而从长期角度，它则是称重机。

“In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it’s a weighing machine.

<br>

“重量最终是有影响的。但在短期内，投票的影响力较大。而这种投票方式并不十分民主。遗憾的是，他们并没有设立任何投票资格能力测试，就如你们所了解的那样。”

“Weight counts eventually. But votes count in the short term. And it’s a very undemocratic way of voting. Unfortunately, they have no literacy tests in terms of voting qualifications, as you’ve all learned.”

<br>

巴菲特按下了一个按钮，他右侧的巨大屏幕上亮起了一个 PowerPoint 幻灯片。[^2]坐在观众席上的比尔·盖茨屏住了呼吸，直到以笨手笨脚而著名的巴菲特成功展示出第一张幻灯片。[^3]

Buffett clicked a button, which illuminated a PowerPoint slide on a huge screen to his right.17 Bill Gates, sitting in the audience, caught his breath until the notoriously fumble-fingered Buffett managed to get the first slide up.

| Dow Jones Industrial Average  |         |
|-------------------------------|---------|
| December 31, 1964             | 874.12  |
| December 31, 1981             | 875.00  |

<br>

他走向屏幕开始解释。

He walked over to the screen and started explaining.

<br>

“在这十七年里，经济规模增长了五倍。《财富》五百强公司的销售额增长了五倍以上。* 然而，在这十七年中，股市几乎毫无变化。”

“During these seventeen years, the size of the economy grew fivefold. The sales of the Fortune five hundred companies grew more than fivefold.* Yet, during these seventeen years, the stock market went exactly nowhere.”

<br>

他后退了一两步。“当你投资时，你正在做的是延迟消费，现在花钱以便在未来的某个时候获取更多的回报。这里真正只有两个问题。一个是你能拿回多少，另一个是何时拿回。

He backed up a step or two. “What you’re doing when you invest is deferring consumption and laying money out now to get more money back at a later time. And there are really only two questions. One is how much you’re going to get back, and the other is when.

<br>

“现在，伊索并不擅长金融，因为他说过类似这样的话，‘手中一鸟胜过林中两鸟。’ 但他没有说什么时候。”利率——借款的成本——巴菲特解释说，是“何时”的价格。它们对金融就像引力对物理学一样。随着利率的变化，所有金融资产——房屋、股票、债券的价值都会改变，就好像鸟的价格发生了波动。“这就是为什么有时手中的一只鸟比林中的两只鸟更好，有时林中的两只鸟比手中的一只鸟更好。”

“Now, Aesop was not much of a finance major, because he said something like, ‘A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.’ But he doesn’t say when.” Interest rates—the cost of borrowing—Buffett explained, are the price of “when.” They are to finance as gravity is to physics. As interest rates vary, the value of all financial assets—houses, stocks, bonds—changes, as if the price of birds had fluctuated. “And that’s why sometimes a bird in the hand is better than two birds in the bush and sometimes two in the bush are better than one in the hand.”

<br>

他以平淡、气息急促的口吻说话，言辞之快，有时连他自己都跟不上。巴菲特将伊索的寓言与1990年代的大牛市联系起来，他形容这是一场空洞的牛市。利润增长远不及之前的那个时期，但由于利率低，林中的鸟价格昂贵。很少有人愿意在如此低的利率下持有现金——手中的鸟。所以，投资者们为了那些林中的鸟付出了前所未有的价格。巴菲特轻描淡写地将此称为“贪婪因素”。

In his flat, breathy twang, the words coming so fast that they sometimes ran over one another, Buffett related Aesop to the great bull market of the 1990s, which he described as baloney. Profits had grown much less than in that previous period, but birds in the bush were expensive because interest rates were low. Fewer people wanted cash—the bird in the hand—at such low rates. So investors were paying unheard-of prices for those birds in the bush. Casually, Buffett referred to this as the “greed factor.”

<br>

全场观众，都是在大牛市中变得富有的科技大佬们，他们在改变世界。他们静静地坐着，他们的投资组合中塞满了估值超高的股票。他们对此感到十分满意。这是一个新的模式，互联网时代的曙光。他们认为巴菲特没有权利称他们贪婪。沃伦——他积蓄了多年，很少有慷慨之举，他如此节俭，以至于他的车牌上写着“节约”，他大部分时间都在考虑如何赚钱，他错过了科技繁荣和机会——他在他们的香槟里吐口水。

The audience, full of technology gurus who were changing the world while getting rich off the great bull market, sat silent. They were perched atop portfolios that were jam-packed with stocks trading at extravagant valuations. They felt terrific about that. It was a new paradigm, this dawning of the Internet age. Their attitude was that Buffett had no right to call them greedy. Warren—who’d hoarded his money for years and given very little away, who was so cheap his license plate said “Thrifty,” who spent most of his time thinking about how to make money, who had blown the technology boom and missed the boat—was spitting in their champagne.

<br>

巴菲特继续说道。股市能以每年十分之一或更多的速度持续上升，只有三种可能。一种是如果利率下降并保持在历史水平以下。第二种是如果分给投资者的经济份额，相对于给雇员和政府以及其他事物的份额，上升到已经历史性高位的水平。[^4] 或者，他说，经济可能开始增长得比正常水平更快。[^5]他称使用这些乐观的假设是“一厢情愿”的想法。

Buffett continued. There were only three ways the stock market could keep rising at ten percent or more a year. One was if interest rates fell and remained below historic levels. The second was if the share of the economy that went to investors, as opposed to employees and government and other things, rose above its already historically high level.19 Or, he said, the economy could start growing faster than normal.20 He called it “wishful thinking” to use optimistic assumptions like these.

[^4]: 当时的企业利润超过 GDP 的 6%，而长期平均水平为 4.88%。 他们后来升至 9% 以上，远高于历史标准。Corporate profits at the time were more than 6% of GDP, compared to a long-term average of 4.88%. They later rose to over 9%, far above historic standards.

[^5]: 长期以来，美国经济的实际增长率为 3%，名义增长率（扣除通货膨胀后）为 5%。 除了战后繁荣或从严重衰退中复苏之外，很少有人超过这一水平。Over long periods the U.S. economy has grown at a real rate of 3% and a nominal rate (after inflation) of 5%. Other than a postwar boom or recovery from severe recession, this level is rarely exceeded.
