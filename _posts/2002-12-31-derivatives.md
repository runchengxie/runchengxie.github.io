查理和我对衍生品及其相关的交易活动的看法是一致的：我们认为它们是定时炸弹，不仅对参与其中的各方，也对整个经济体系。

Charlie and I are of one mind in how we feel about derivatives and the trading activities that go with them: We view them as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system.

<br>

在回到这个想法之前，让我先来解释一下衍生品，虽然这个解释必须是很笼统的，因为这个词涵盖了非常广泛的金融合约。基本上，这些工具要求在未来某个日期交换金钱，交换的金额由一个或多个参考项目决定，比如利率、股票价格或货币价值。例如，如果你是标准普尔500期货合约的多头或空头，你就是一个非常简单的衍生品交易的一方——你的盈亏取决于指数的变动。衍生品合约的期限不同（有时长达20年或更长），它们的价值通常与多个变量相关。 

Having delivered that thought, which I’ll get back to, let me retreat to explaining derivatives, though the explanation must be general because the word covers an extraordinarily wide range of financial contracts. Essentially, these instruments call for money to change hands at some future date, with the amount to be determined by one or more reference items, such as interest rates, stock prices, or currency values. If, for example, you are either long or short an S&P 500 futures contract, you are a party to a very simple derivatives transaction--with your gain or loss derived from movements in the index. Derivatives contracts are of varying duration (running sometimes to 20 or more years), and their value is often tied to several variables.

<br>

除非衍生品合约有抵押或担保，否则它们的最终价值也取决于交易对手的信用状况。与此同时，在合约结算之前，交易对手会在他们的当前收益报表中记录利润和损失——通常是巨额的——而没有一分钱的现金流动。

Unless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties to them. In the meantime, though, before a contract is settled, the counterparties record profits and losses--often huge in amount--in their current earnings statements without so much as a penny changing hands.

<br>

衍生品合约的种类只受制于人类（或有时，看起来是疯子）的想象力。例如，在安然公司，一些要在未来多年结算的新闻纸和宽带衍生品被记入账簿。或者说你想写一份合约，来投机2020年在内布拉斯加州出生的双胞胎的数量。没问题——只要出个价，你就会很容易地找到一个愿意合作的对手。

The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen). At Enron, for example, newsprint and broadband derivatives, due to be settled many years in the future, were put on the books. Or say you want to write a contract speculating on the number of twins to be born in Nebraska in 2020. No problem--at a price, you will easily find an obliging counterparty.

<br>

当我们购买了通用再保险公司时，它附带了一个我们不想要的衍生品交易商，通用再保险证券公司。我和查理认为这是危险的。然而，我们在出售这个业务的尝试中失败了，现在正在终止它。

When we purchased Gen Re, it came with General Re Securities, a derivatives dealer that Charlie and I didn’t want, judging it to be dangerous. We failed in our attempts to sell the operation, however, and are now terminating it.

<br>

但是关闭一个衍生品业务并不是说说而已。在我们完全退出这个业务之前（尽管我们每天都在减少我们的风险敞口），还需要很多年的时间。事实上，再保险和衍生品业务是相似的：像地狱一样，两者都很容易进入，几乎无法退出。在这两个行业中，一旦你写了一个合同——可能在几十年后需要支付一笔巨额款项——你通常就被卡住了。当然，有一些方法可以把风险转嫁给其他人。但是大多数这样的策略都会给你留下残余的责任。

But closing down a derivatives business is easier said than done. It will be a great many years before we are totally out of this operation (though we reduce our exposure daily). In fact, the reinsurance and derivatives businesses are similar: Like Hell, both are easy to enter and almost impossible to exit. In either industry, once you write a contract--which may require a large payment decades later--you are usually stuck with it. True, there are methods by which the risk can be laid off with others. But most strategies of that kind leave you with residual liability.

<br>

再保险和衍生品的另一个共同点是，它们都会产生经常被大大夸大的报告收益。这是因为今天的收益在很大程度上是基于估计，而这些估计的不准确性可能要等到多年后才能暴露出来。

Another commonality of reinsurance and derivatives is that both generate reported earnings that are often wildly overstated. That’s true because today’s earnings are in a significant way based on estimates whose inaccuracy may not be exposed for many years.

<br>

错误通常是诚实的，只反映了人类倾向于对自己的承诺持乐观态度的特点。但是，衍生品的交易方也有巨大的动机在会计上作弊。交易衍生品的人通常是根据按市场价计算的“收益”来支付（全部或部分）的。但是，往往没有真正的市场（想想我们涉及双胞胎的合同），而是使用“按模型计算”。这种替代可能会引发大规模的恶作剧。一般来说，涉及多个参考项目和遥远结算日期的合同增加了交易对手使用荒诞假设的机会。例如，在双胞胎的情景中，合同的双方可能会使用不同的模型，使他们都能显示出多年来的可观利润。在极端情况下，按模型计算退化为我所称的按神话计算。

Errors will usually be honest, reflecting only the human tendency to take an optimistic view of one’s commitments. But the parties to derivatives also have enormous incentives to cheat in accounting for them. Those who trade derivatives are usually paid (in whole or part) on “earnings” calculated by mark-to-market accounting. But often there is no real market (think about our contract involving twins) and “mark-to-model” is utilized. This substitution can bring on large-scale mischief. As a general rule, contracts involving multiple reference items and distant settlement dates increase the opportunities for counterparties to use fanciful assumptions. In the twins scenario, for example, the two parties to the contract might well use differing models allowing both to show substantial profits for many years. In extreme cases, mark-to-model degenerates into what I would call mark-to-myth.

<br>

当然，内部和外部的审计师都会审查这些数字，但这并不是一件容易的工作。例如，年底时（在停止运营十个月后），General Re Securities有14,384份合同未结清，涉及世界各地的672个交易对手。每份合同都有一个正负值，由一个或多个参考项目决定，其中一些非常复杂。对于这样的投资组合，即使是专业的审计师，也可能会诚实地有很大的意见分歧。

Of course, both internal and outside auditors review the numbers, but that’s no easy job. For example, General Re Securities at year-end (after ten months of winding down its operation) had 14,384 contracts outstanding, involving 672 counterparties around the world. Each contract had a plus or minus value derived from one or more reference items, including some of mind-boggling complexity. Valuing a portfolio like that, expert auditors could easily and honestly have widely varying opinions.
