奥马哈

我们的领导人要求“共同牺牲”。但是当他们这样要求的时候，他们没有碰我。我问了我的超级富有的朋友，他们期待什么样的痛苦。他们也没有受到影响。

OUR leaders have asked for “shared sacrifice.” But when they did the asking, they spared me. I checked with my mega-rich friends to learn what pain they were expecting. They, too, were left untouched.

当穷人和中产阶级在阿富汗为我们而战，当大多数美国人努力维持生计时，我们这些超级富豪继续享受我们非凡的税收优惠。我们中的一些人是投资经理，每天的劳动收入高达数十亿美元，但却被允许将我们的收入归类为“承担利益”，从而享受15%的优惠税率。还有一些人持有10分钟的股指期货，他们60%的收益按15%的税率征税，就好像他们是长期投资者一样。

While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks. Some of us are investment managers who earn billions from our daily labors but are allowed to classify our income as “carried interest,” thereby getting a bargain 15 percent tax rate. Others own stock index futures for 10 minutes and have 60 percent of their gain taxed at 15 percent, as if they’d been long-term investors.

这些和其他的恩惠都是由华盛顿的立法者们赐予我们的，他们觉得有必要保护我们，就好像我们是斑点猫头鹰或者其他什么濒危物种一样。有高位的朋友真好。

These and other blessings are showered upon us by legislators in Washington who feel compelled to protect us, much as if we were spotted owls or some other endangered species. It’s nice to have friends in high places.

Last year my federal tax bill — the income tax I paid, as well as payroll taxes paid by me and on my behalf — was $6,938,744. That sounds like a lot of money. But what I paid was only 17.4 percent of my taxable income — and that’s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office. Their tax burdens ranged from 33 percent to 41 percent and averaged 36 percent.
