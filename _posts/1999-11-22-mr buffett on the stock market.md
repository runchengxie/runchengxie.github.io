*《财富》杂志 - 伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司的董事长沃伦·巴菲特几乎从不公开谈论股价的总体水平——无论是在他著名的年度报告中，还是在伯克希尔人山人海的年度会议上，亦或是他偶尔的演讲中。然而，在过去的几个月里，巴菲特在四个场合针对这个主题发表了观点，以分析和创新的方式阐述了他对股票长期前景的看法。《财富》杂志的卡罗尔·洛米斯听到了他在九月份对一群巴菲特的朋友们（她也是其中之一）的最后一次演讲，也观看了他在七月份在爱伦·公司在爱达荷州太阳谷为商业领袖们举办的派对上的第一次演讲的录像。洛米斯从这些即兴演讲中（第一次演讲时道琼斯工业平均指数为11194）提炼出了巴菲特说过的内容，巴菲特审阅了它，并对一些内容进行了澄清。*

*(FORTUNE Magazine) – Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, almost never talks publicly about the general level of stock prices--neither in his famed annual report nor at Berkshire's thronged annual meetings nor in the rare speeches he gives. But in the past few months, on four occasions, Buffett did step up to that subject, laying out his opinions, in ways both analytical and creative, about the long-term future for stocks. FORTUNE's Carol Loomis heard the last of those talks, given in September to a group of Buffett's friends (of whom she is one), and also watched a videotape of the first speech, given in July at Allen & Co.'s Sun Valley, Idaho, bash for business leaders. From those extemporaneous talks (the first made with the Dow Jones industrial average at 11,194), Loomis distilled the following account of what Buffett said. Buffett reviewed it and weighed in with some clarifications.*

现在的股票投资者期望过高，我将解释为什么。这将不可避免地让我谈到市场整体行情，这是我通常不愿讨论的主题。但我想在一开始就明确一件事：尽管我将谈论市场的水平，我不会预测它的下一步动向。在伯克希尔，我们几乎专注于个别公司的估值，对整体市场的估值只有非常有限的关注。即使是这样，评估市场与它下周、下个月或明年将走向何方无关，这是我们从不涉足的思考方式。事实上，市场的行为方式，有时会在很长一段时间内，与价值无关。但是，迟早，价值是重要的。所以，我要说的——假设它是正确的——将对美国股票持有人实现的长期结果产生影响。

Investors in stocks these days are expecting far too much, and I'm going to explain why. That will inevitably set me to talking about the general stock market, a subject I'm usually unwilling to discuss. But I want to make one thing clear going in: Though I will be talking about the level of the market, I will not be predicting its next moves. At Berkshire we focus almost exclusively on the valuations of individual companies, looking only to a very limited extent at the valuation of the overall market. Even then, valuing the market has nothing to do with where it's going to go next week or next month or next year, a line of thought we never get into. The fact is that markets behave in ways, sometimes for a very long stretch, that are not linked to value. Sooner or later, though, value counts. So what I am going to be saying--assuming it's correct--will have implications for the long-term results to be realized by American stockholders.

<br>

首先，让我们定义一下“投资”。这个定义很简单但经常被忽视：投资就是现在投入资金，期待未来获得更多的资金回报——在考虑通胀因素后，是更多的实际资金。

Let's start by defining "investing." The definition is simple but often forgotten: Investing is laying out money now to get more money back in the future--more money in real terms, after taking inflation into account.

<br>

现在，为了获取一些历史视角，让我们回顾一下这之前的34年——在这里我们将看到一个近乎《圣经》式的对称，意味着瘦年和丰年——来观察股市发生了什么。首先，从1964年底到1981年的这17年时间，让我们看看在这个时间间隔内发生了什么：

Now, to get some historical perspective, let's look back at the 34 years before this one--and here we are going to see an almost Biblical kind of symmetry, in the sense of lean years and fat years--to observe what happened in the stock market. Take, to begin with, the first 17 years of the period, from the end of 1964 through 1981. Here's what took place in that interval:

<br>

道琼斯工业平均指数 1964年12月31日：874.12 1981年12月31日：875.00

DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE Dec. 31, 1964: 874.12 Dec. 31, 1981: 875.00

<br>

即使我以长期投资和耐心著称，但我也不认为这是大幅波动。

Now I'm known as a long-term investor and a patient guy, but that is not my idea of a big move.

<br>

另一个主要而截然不同的事实是：在同样的17年期间，美国的GDP——也就是这个国家的商业活动——几乎翻了五倍，增长了370%。或者，如果我们看另一个衡量标准，FORTUNE 500的销售（当然是不断变化的公司组合）增长了六倍多。然而，道琼斯指数却一直没有变动。

And here's a major and very opposite fact: During that same 17 years, the GDP of the U.S.--that is, the business being done in this country--almost quintupled, rising by 370%. Or, if we look at another measure, the sales of the FORTUNE 500 (a changing mix of companies, of course) more than sextupled. And yet the Dow went exactly nowhere.

<br>

为了理解为什么会这样，我们首先需要看一下影响投资结果的两个重要变量之一：利率。利率对金融估值的影响就像重力对物质的影响：利率越高，下拉的力度就越大。那是因为投资者从任何类型的投资中需要的回报率直接与他们可以从政府债券中获得的无风险利率相挂钩。因此，如果政府利率上升，所有其他投资的价格必须向下调整，以便将其预期回报率保持在一致的水平。反之，如果政府利率下降，这个动作会推高所有其他投资的价格。基本的原理是：投资者今天应该为明天将要收到的一美元支付多少钱，只能首先看一下无风险利率。

To understand why that happened, we need first to look at one of the two important variables that affect investment results: interest rates. These act on financial valuations the way gravity acts on matter: The higher the rate, the greater the downward pull. That's because the rates of return that investors need from any kind of investment are directly tied to the risk-free rate that they can earn from government securities. So if the government rate rises, the prices of all other investments must adjust downward, to a level that brings their expected rates of return into line. Conversely, if government interest rates fall, the move pushes the prices of all other investments upward. The basic proposition is this: What an investor should pay today for a dollar to be received tomorrow can only be determined by first looking at the risk-free interest rate.

<br>

因此，每当无风险利率移动一个基点（0.01%）时，该国每项投资的价值都会发生变化。人们可以很容易地在债券的情况下看到这一点，债券的价值通常只受到利率的影响。在股票、房地产、农场或其他领域的情况下，通常还有其他非常重要的变量在起作用，这意味着利率变化的影响通常被掩盖。尽管如此，这种影响就像无形的引力一样，始终存在。

Consequently, every time the risk-free rate moves by one basis point--by 0.01%--the value of every investment in the country changes. People can see this easily in the case of bonds, whose value is normally affected only by interest rates. In the case of equities or real estate or farms or whatever, other very important variables are almost always at work, and that means the effect of interest rate changes is usually obscured. Nonetheless, the effect--like the invisible pull of gravity--is constantly there.

<br>

在1964年至1981年的时期，长期政府债券利率出现了巨大增长，从1964年年末略高于4%上升到1981年末的超过15%。利率的上涨对所有投资价值产生了巨大的抑制作用，但我们当然会注意到的是股票的价格。因此，在利率的引力增加三倍的情况下，这就是为什么经济的巨大增长伴随着股市一片寂静的主要解释所在。

In the 1964-81 period, there was a tremendous increase in the rates on long-term government bonds, which moved from just over 4% at year-end 1964 to more than 15% by late 1981. That rise in rates had a huge depressing effect on the value of all investments, but the one we noticed, of course, was the price of equities. So there--in that tripling of the gravitational pull of interest rates--lies the major explanation of why tremendous growth in the economy was accompanied by a stock market going nowhere.

<br>

然后，在20世纪80年代初，情况发生了逆转。你会记得保罗·沃尔克出任美联储主席的情况，也会记得他当时是多么不受欢迎。但他所做的英勇事情——他对经济的举措和对通胀的遏制——导致了利率趋势的逆转，取得了一些相当惊人的结果。假设你在1981年11月16日购买了面值为1百万美元、利率为14%、期限为30年的美国国债，并将票息再投资。也就是说，每当你获得一笔利息支付，你用它来购买更多同一种债券。到1998年底，当时长期政府债券的利率降至5%，你将拥有8,181,219美元，并获得每年超过13%的回报率。

Then, in the early 1980s, the situation reversed itself. You will remember Paul Volcker coming in as chairman of the Fed and remember also how unpopular he was. But the heroic things he did--his taking a two-by-four to the economy and breaking the back of inflation--caused the interest rate trend to reverse, with some rather spectacular results. Let's say you put $1 million into the 14% 30-year U.S. bond issued Nov. 16, 1981, and reinvested the coupons. That is, every time you got an interest payment, you used it to buy more of that same bond. At the end of 1998, with long-term governments by then selling at 5%, you would have had $8,181,219 and would have earned an annual return of more than 13%.

<br>

这种每年13%的回报率比历史上许多17年期间股票的表现要好——事实上，在大多数17年期间都如此。这是一个了不起的结果，而且是来自一张普通的债券。

That 13% annual return is better than stocks have done in a great many 17-year periods in history--in most 17-year periods, in fact. It was a helluva result, and from none other than a stodgy bond.

<br>

利率的影响力也推动了股票的上涨，尽管其他因素也起到了额外的推动作用，我们接下来会提到这些因素。在同样的17年时间里，股票的表现如下：如果你在1981年11月16日投资了100万美元在道琼斯指数，并将所有股息再投资，你到1998年12月31日将拥有19,720,112美元。你的年回报率将达到19%。

The power of interest rates had the effect of pushing up equities as well, though other things that we will get to pushed additionally. And so here's what equities did in that same 17 years: If you'd invested $1 million in the Dow on Nov. 16, 1981, and reinvested all dividends, you'd have had $19,720,112 on Dec. 31, 1998. And your annual return would have been 19%.

<br>

自1981年以来，股票价值的增长超过了历史上任何时期的表现。这个增长甚至超过了你在1932年购买股票的情况——当时正值经济大萧条，最低点是1932年7月8日，道琼斯指数收于41.22点——并持有它们17年的情况。

The increase in equity values since 1981 beats anything you can find in history. This increase even surpasses what you would have realized if you'd bought stocks in 1932, at their Depression bottom--on its lowest day, July 8, 1932, the Dow closed at 41.22--and held them for 17 years.

<br>

![After-tax corporate profits as apercent of GDP](/images/After-tax%20corporate%20profits%20as%20apercent%20of%20GDP.png)

第二个影响这17年股票价格的因素是税后企业利润，这张图表显示了税后企业利润占GDP的百分比。实际上，这张图表告诉你的是美国企业股东每年从GDP中获得了多少份额。

The second thing bearing on stock prices during this 17 years was after-tax corporate profits, which this chart [above] displays as a percentage of GDP. In effect, what this chart tells you is what portion of the GDP ended up every year with the shareholders of American business.

<br>

你会看到，图表开始于1929年。我对1929年颇有好感，因为那是我开始的时候。我的父亲当时是股票销售员，当秋天的股灾来临后，他害怕打电话给任何人——所有那些受伤的人。所以他下午就呆在家里。那时候还没有电视。所以......我妈是在大约1929年11月30日（9个月后，1930年8月30日出生）这个时间左右怀孕的，我一直对那次崩溃有一种温暖的感觉。

The chart, as you will see, starts in 1929. I'm quite fond of 1929, since that's when it all began for me. My dad was a stock salesman at the time, and after the Crash came, in the fall, he was afraid to call anyone--all those people who'd been burned. So he just stayed home in the afternoons. And there wasn't television then. Soooo... I was conceived on or about Nov. 30, 1929 (and born nine months later, on Aug. 30, 1930), and I've forever had a kind of warm feeling about the Crash.

<br>

如你所见，企业利润占GDP的比例在1929年达到峰值，然后便直线下跌。图表的左侧实际上充满了异常：不仅有大萧条，还有战时利润繁荣——被超额利润税压制——以及战后的另一次繁荣。但是从1951年开始，这个百分比基本上稳定在4%到6.5%的范围内。

As you can see, corporate profits as a percentage of GDP peaked in 1929, and then they tanked. The left-hand side of the chart, in fact, is filled with aberrations: not only the Depression but also a wartime profits boom--sedated by the excess-profits tax--and another boom after the war. But from 1951 on, the percentage settled down pretty much to a 4% to 6.5% range.

<br>

然而，到1981年，趋势朝着这个区间的底部发展，到1982年利润跌至3.5%。因此，投资者此时面临两个严重的负面因素：利润低于平均水平，利率又高企。

By 1981, though, the trend was headed toward the bottom of that band, and in 1982 profits tumbled to 3.5%. So at that point investors were looking at two strong negatives: Profits were sub-par and interest rates were sky-high.

<br>

正如我们常见的那样，投资者将他们所看到的情况投射到未来。这是他们不可动摇的习惯：总是通过后视镜看事情，而不是透过挡风玻璃向前看。他们从过去看到的情况，让他们对这个国家感到非常沮丧。他们预测利率会上升，预测利润会下降，因此，尽管GDP近乎增长了五倍，他们仍然以17年前的水平来评估道琼斯指数。

And as is so typical, investors projected out into the future what they were seeing. That's their unshakable habit: looking into the rear-view mirror instead of through the windshield. What they were observing, looking backward, made them very discouraged about the country. They were projecting high interest rates, they were projecting low profits, and they were therefore valuing the Dow at a level that was the same as 17 years earlier, even though GDP had nearly quintupled.

<br>

那么，从1982年开始的这17年里发生了什么呢？一件并未发生的事情是GDP的相应增长：在这第二个17年期间，GDP不到三倍。但利率开始下降，而在沃尔克效应消退后，利润开始攀升——尽管不是稳步的，但无疑是实力强大的。你可以从图表中看到利润的趋势，图表显示，到了20世纪90年代末，税后利润占GDP的百分比接近6%，这在"正常"范围内是偏上的。而到了1998年底，长期政府利率已经降到5%左右。

Now, what happened in the 17 years beginning with 1982? One thing that didn't happen was comparable growth in GDP: In this second 17-year period, GDP less than tripled. But interest rates began their descent, and after the Volcker effect wore off, profits began to climb--not steadily, but nonetheless with real power. You can see the profit trend in the chart, which shows that by the late 1990s, after-tax profits as a percent of GDP were running close to 6%, which is on the upper part of the "normalcy" band. And at the end of 1998, long-term government interest rates had made their way down to that 5%.

<br>

对投资者来说，最重要的两个基本因素的巨大变化，虽然不能完全解释，但在很大程度上解释了这17年期间股票价格的十倍以上的上涨——道琼斯指数从875上升到9，181。当然，影响这一切的还有市场心理。一旦牛市开始，一旦你达到每个人无论采取什么策略都能赚钱的地步，就会有一群人被吸引进来，他们的反应不是对利率和利润，而只是对错过股市的恐惧。实际上，这些人在市场驱动的基本因素之上，叠加了一种我不能错过这场派对的因素。就像巴甫洛夫的狗，这些"投资者"学会了，当钟声响起——在这个例子中，是早上9点半开启纽约股票交易所的那个钟声——他们就能得到食物。通过这种日常的强化，他们确信存在一个上帝，并且他希望他们富裕。

These dramatic changes in the two fundamentals that matter most to investors explain much, though not all, of the more than tenfold rise in equity prices--the Dow went from 875 to 9,181-- during this 17-year period. What was at work also, of course, was market psychology. Once a bull market gets under way, and once you reach the point where everybody has made money no matter what system he or she followed, a crowd is attracted into the game that is responding not to interest rates and profits but simply to the fact that it seems a mistake to be out of stocks. In effect, these people superimpose an I-can't-miss-the-party factor on top of the fundamental factors that drive the market. Like Pavlov's dog, these "investors" learn that when the bell rings--in this case, the one that opens the New York Stock Exchange at 9:30 a.m.--they get fed. Through this daily reinforcement, they become convinced that there is a God and that He wants them to get rich.

<br>

今天，大多数投资者盯着他们刚走过的路，满怀乐观的期待。潘瑞伟伯和盖洛普组织在7月发布的一项调查显示，最没有经验的投资者——那些投资不到五年的人——预期未来十年的年回报率为22.6%。即使是那些投资超过20年的人，也预期回报率为12.9%。

Today, staring fixedly back at the road they just traveled, most investors have rosy expectations. A Paine Webber and Gallup Organization survey released in July shows that the least experienced investors--those who have invested for less than five years--expect annual returns over the next ten years of 22.6%. Even those who have invested for more than 20 years are expecting 12.9%.

<br>

现在，我想要说的是，我们甚至无法接近那12.9%，我会通过考察关键的价值决定因素来阐述我的观点。今天，如果一个投资者想在未来十年或17年或20年在市场上获得丰厚的利润，以下三件事情必须至少发生一个。我会稍后再谈最后一件事情，但这是前两个：

Now, I'd like to argue that we can't come even remotely close to that 12.9%, and make my case by examining the key value-determining factors. Today, if an investor is to achieve juicy profits in the market over ten years or 17 or 20, one or more of three things must happen. I'll delay talking about the last of them for a bit, but here are the first two:

<br>

（1）利率必须进一步下降。如果政府利率，现在约为6%，如果下降到3%，仅这一因素就足以将普通股的价值提高近一倍。顺便说一下，如果你认为利率会这样做--或者下降到日本经历过的1%--你应该去能真正赚大钱的地方：债券期权。

(1) Interest rates must fall further. If government interest rates, now at a level of about 6%, were to fall to 3%, that factor alone would come close to doubling the value of common stocks. Incidentally, if you think interest rates are going to do that--or fall to the 1% that Japan has experienced--you should head for where you can really make a bundle: bond options.

<br>

(2) 企业盈利相对于国内生产总值（GDP）必须上升。你知道，有人曾经告诉我，纽约的律师数量超过了人口数量。我想这个人也相信利润会超过GDP。当你开始期望一个组成因素的增长永远超过总体的时候，你就会遇到一些数学问题。在我看来，你必须非常乐观才能相信，企业利润占GDP的百分比，能在任何持续的时期内，保持在6%以上。一个保持这个百分比的因素将是竞争，它是活生生的存在。此外，还有一个公共政策的观点：如果企业投资者总体上要吃掉美国经济大饼的越来越大的一部分，那么其他群体就必须接受更小的一部分。这会引发正当的政治问题——在我看来，这种大规模的重新分配饼干是不会发生的。

(2) Corporate profitability in relation to GDP must rise. You know, someone once told me that New York has more lawyers than people. I think that's the same fellow who thinks profits will become larger than GDP. When you begin to expect the growth of a component factor to forever outpace that of the aggregate, you get into certain mathematical problems. In my opinion, you have to be wildly optimistic to believe that corporate profits as a percent of GDP can, for any sustained period, hold much above 6%. One thing keeping the percentage down will be competition, which is alive and well. In addition, there's a public-policy point: If corporate investors, in aggregate, are going to eat an ever-growing portion of the American economic pie, some other group will have to settle for a smaller portion. That would justifiably raise political problems--and in my view a major reslicing of the pie just isn't going to happen.

<br>

那么，一些合理的假设会引导我们走向何处呢？假设GDP每年平均增长5%——实际增长3%，这已经相当不错了，再加上2%的通胀。如果GDP以5%的速度增长，而你不能从利率那里得到一些帮助，那么股票的总体价值就不会增长太多。是的，你可以从股息中获得一些回报。但是，随着股票在今天的价格上卖出，股息对总回报的重要性已经大不如前了。投资者也不能期待因为公司忙于通过回购股票来提高每股收益而获得高分。这里的抵消因素是，公司几乎同样忙于发行新股，既有通过首次公开发行，也有那些永远存在的股票期权。

So where do some reasonable assumptions lead us? Let's say that GDP grows at an average 5% a year--3% real growth, which is pretty darn good, plus 2% inflation. If GDP grows at 5%, and you don't have some help from interest rates, the aggregate value of equities is not going to grow a whole lot more. Yes, you can add on a bit of return from dividends. But with stocks selling where they are today, the importance of dividends to total return is way down from what it used to be. Nor can investors expect to score because companies are busy boosting their per-share earnings by buying in their stock. The offset here is that the companies are just about as busy issuing new stock, both through primary offerings and those ever present stock options.

<br>

所以我回到我对GDP 5%增长的假设，并提醒你这是你将获得回报的限制因素：如果美国企业的盈利只增长5%，你就不能期望永远实现12%的年增长——更不用说22%了。无法回避的事实是，无论资产的性质如何，其价值长期来看不能增长得比其盈利快。

So I come back to my postulation of 5% growth in GDP and remind you that it is a limiting factor in the returns you're going to get: You cannot expect to forever realize a 12% annual increase--much less 22%--in the valuation of American business if its profitability is growing only at 5%. The inescapable fact is that the value of an asset, whatever its character, cannot over the long term grow faster than its earnings do.

<br>

现在，也许你想要提出一个不同的观点。那也说得通。但是给我你的假设。如果你认为美国公众每年能在股票中赚取12%，我想你必须说，比如，“那是因为我预计GDP每年将增长10%，股息将为回报增加两个百分点，利率将保持恒定。”或者你必须以其他方式重新安排这些关键变量。只是简单的信仰——如果你相信就鼓掌——是行不通的。

Now, maybe you'd like to argue a different case. Fair enough. But give me your assumptions. If you think the American public is going to make 12% a year in stocks, I think you have to say, for example, "Well, that's because I expect GDP to grow at 10% a year, dividends to add two percentage points to returns, and interest rates to stay at a constant level." Or you've got to rearrange these key variables in some other manner. The Tinker Bell approach--clap if you believe--just won't cut it.

<br>

除此之外，你需要记住，未来的回报总是受到当前估值的影响，并需要考虑一下你现在在股市中用你的钱能得到什么。下面是1998年《财富》500强的两个数据。这些公司占了所有公开持有的美国企业价值的大约75%，所以当你看这500家公司时，你实际上在谈论的是美国公司。

Beyond that, you need to remember that future returns are always affected by current valuations and give some thought to what you're getting for your money in the stock market right now. Here are two 1998 figures for the FORTUNE 500. The companies in this universe account for about 75% of the value of all publicly owned American businesses, so when you look at the 500, you're really talking about America Inc.

<br>

《财富》500强1998年的利润：334,335,000,000美元 
1999年3月15日的市场价值：9,907,233,000,000美元

FORTUNE 500 1998 profits: $334,335,000,000 Market value on March 15, 1999: $9,907,233,000,000

<br>

当我们关注这两个数字时，我们需要意识到，利润数字有其特殊之处。1998年的利润包括一个非常特殊的项目——福特公司在剥离Associates公司时报告的160亿美元的账务收益——同时，利润中也包括了一些，如State Farm这样的互助公司的收益，这些公司没有市场价值。此外，一个主要的公司费用，即股票期权补偿成本，没有从利润中扣除。另一方面，利润数字在某些情况下由于冲销而减少，这可能并没有反映经济现实，也可以重新计算回来。但是，忽略这些限定条件，投资者在今年3月15日表示，他们愿意为3340亿美元的利润支付高达10万亿美元。

As we focus on those two numbers, we need to be aware that the profits figure has its quirks. Profits in 1998 included one very unusual item--a $16 billion bookkeeping gain that Ford reported from its spinoff of Associates--and profits also included, as they always do in the 500, the earnings of a few mutual companies, such as State Farm, that do not have a market value. Additionally, one major corporate expense, stock-option compensation costs, is not deducted from profits. On the other hand, the profits figure has been reduced in some cases by write-offs that probably didn't reflect economic reality and could just as well be added back in. But leaving aside these qualifications, investors were saying on March 15 this year that they would pay a hefty $10 trillion for the $334 billion in profits.

<br>

请记住——这是一个经常被忽视的关键事实——投资者总的来说不能从他们的企业中得到任何超出企业所赚的东西。当然，你和我可以以越来越高的价格相互出售股票。假设《财富》500强只是一家企业，而在这个房间里的每个人都拥有其中的一部分。在这种情况下，我们可以坐在这里，以越来越高的价格互相出售股份。你个人可能会通过低买高卖来比下一个人更聪明。但当这种情况发生时，没有钱会离开这个游戏：你只是取走他投入的。同时，群体的经验不会受到丝毫影响，因为其命运仍然与利润挂钩。总的来说，一家企业的所有者最终能从中获得的绝对最大收益——从现在到最后的审判日——就是那家企业随着时间的推移所赚的钱。

Bear in mind--this is a critical fact often ignored--that investors as a whole cannot get anything out of their businesses except what the businesses earn. Sure, you and I can sell each other stocks at higher and higher prices. Let's say the FORTUNE 500 was just one business and that the people in this room each owned a piece of it. In that case, we could sit here and sell each other pieces at ever-ascending prices. You personally might outsmart the next fellow by buying low and selling high. But no money would leave the game when that happened: You'd simply take out what he put in. Meanwhile, the experience of the group wouldn't have been affected a whit, because its fate would still be tied to profits. The absolute most that the owners of a business, in aggregate, can get out of it in the end--between now and Judgment Day--is what that business earns over time.

<br>

还有另一个需要考虑的主要限制。如果你和我在这个房间里交易我们企业的一部分，我们可以避开交易成本，因为没有经纪人在我们每次交易中都要分一杯羹。但在现实世界中，投资者有想要换座位的习惯，或者至少会花钱获取是否应该这样做的建议，这需要花费大量的金钱。他们承担的费用——我称之为摩擦成本——包括广泛的项目。有做市商的差价，佣金，销售负担，12b-1费用，管理费用，托管费，包装费，甚至是金融刊物的订阅费。不要把这些费用当作无关紧要的事。如果你在评估一份投资房地产，你会不会在计算回报率时扣除管理成本？是的，当然——以完全相同的方式，计算他们的回报的股市投资者必须面对他们承担的摩擦成本。

And there's still another major qualification to be considered. If you and I were trading pieces of our business in this room, we could escape transactional costs because there would be no brokers around to take a bite out of every trade we made. But in the real world investors have a habit of wanting to change chairs, or of at least getting advice as to whether they should, and that costs money--big money. The expenses they bear--I call them frictional costs--are for a wide range of items. There's the market maker's spread, and commissions, and sales loads, and 12b-1 fees, and management fees, and custodial fees, and wrap fees, and even subscriptions to financial publications. And don't brush these expenses off as irrelevancies. If you were evaluating a piece of investment real estate, would you not deduct management costs in figuring your return? Yes, of course--and in exactly the same way, stock market investors who are figuring their returns must face up to the frictional costs they bear.

<br>

那么，他们需要支付多少呢？我估计，美国股票的投资者每年支付超过1000亿美元——比如说，1300亿美元——来换椅子，或者购买有关他们是否应该这样做的建议！其中大约有1000亿美元与《财富》500强有关。换句话说，投资者正在将《财富》500强为他们赚取的所有收益——1998年的3340亿美元——的近三分之一，交给各种各样的换椅子和椅子咨询“助手”。当这种交接完成后，拥有500强的投资者在他们的10万亿美元的投资上获得的回报不到2500亿美元。在我看来，这是微不足道的收益。

<br>

And what do they come to? My estimate is that investors in American stocks pay out well over $100 billion a year--say, $130 billion--to move around on those chairs or to buy advice as to whether they should! Perhaps $100 billion of that relates to the FORTUNE 500. In other words, investors are dissipating almost a third of everything that the FORTUNE 500 is earning for them--that $334 billion in 1998--by handing it over to various types of chair-changing and chair-advisory "helpers." And when that handoff is completed, the investors who own the 500 are reaping less than a $250 billion return on their $10 trillion investment. In my view, that's slim pickings.

<br>

也许到现在你已经在心里和我对那些“助手”流向的1000亿美元的估计产生了争议。他们是如何向你收费的呢？让我来数一数。首先是交易成本，包括佣金，做市商的收入，和承销发行的差价：剔除双重计算后，今年在美国至少会有3500亿股股票交易，我估计每股的交易成本——即买方和卖方的成本——平均为6美分。这加起来就是420亿美元。

Perhaps by now you're mentally quarreling with my estimate that $100 billion flows to those "helpers." How do they charge thee? Let me count the ways. Start with transaction costs, including commissions, the market maker's take, and the spread on underwritten offerings: With double counting stripped out, there will this year be at least 350 billion shares of stock traded in the U.S., and I would estimate that the transaction cost per share for each side--that is, for both the buyer and the seller--will average 6 cents. That adds up to $42 billion.

<br>

继续讨论额外的成本：对于拥有包装账户的小投资者来说，费用很高；对于大投资者来说，管理费也不菲；而对于国内股票共同基金的持有者来说，一大笔费用正悬在头顶。这些基金目前的资产总额约为3.5万亿美元，我们必须得出这样一个结论：每年这些基金给投资者带来的成本（包括管理费、销售费、12b-1费用、一般运营成本）至少占1%，也就是350亿美元。

Move on to the additional costs: hefty charges for little guys who have wrap accounts; management fees for big guys; and, looming very large, a raft of expenses for the holders of domestic equity mutual funds. These funds now have assets of about $3.5 trillion, and you have to conclude that the annual cost of these to their investors--counting management fees, sales loads, 12b-1 fees, general operating costs--runs to at least 1%, or $35 billion.

<br>

到目前为止，我所描述的损失还没有包括期权和期货的佣金和价差，也没有包括可变年金持有者所承担的成本，更不用说那些“助手们”能够想出的无数其他费用了。简而言之，对于财富500强的所有者来说，1000亿美元的摩擦成本（占500强市值的1%）在我看来，不仅是一个非常有力的估计，而且很可能偏低。

And none of the damage I've so far described counts the commissions and spreads on options and futures, or the costs borne by holders of variable annuities, or the myriad other charges that the "helpers" manage to think up. In short, $100 billion of frictional costs for the owners of the FORTUNE 500--which is 1% of the 500's market value--looks to me not only highly defensible as an estimate, but quite possibly on the low side.

<br>

这看起来也是一个可怕的成本。我曾听说过一个漫画，其中一位新闻评论员说：“今天纽约证券交易所没有交易。每个人都对自己拥有的东西感到满意。”那么，如果真的是这样的话，投资者每年将能在口袋里多留下大约1300亿美元。

It also looks like a horrendous cost. I heard once about a cartoon in which a news commentator says, "There was no trading on the New York Stock Exchange today. Everyone was happy with what they owned." Well, if that were really the case, investors would every year keep around $130 billion in their pockets.

<br>

让我总结一下我对股市的看法：我认为很难找到一个有说服力的理由，证明在未来17年里，股票的表现会像过去的17年那样。如果我必须选择一个最可能的回报，即股价上涨和股息相结合，那么在一个利率恒定、通货膨胀2%以及摩擦成本持续伤害的世界里，投资者整体（重复，整体）所能获得的回报可能是6%。如果你从这个名义回报中剔除通货膨胀成分（不管通货膨胀如何波动，都需要这样做），那么实际回报就是4%。如果4%是错误的，我认为这个百分比很可能会低于或高于这个水平。

Let me summarize what I've been saying about the stock market: I think it's very hard to come up with a persuasive case that equities will over the next 17 years perform anything like--anything like--they've performed in the past 17. If I had to pick the most probable return, from appreciation and dividends combined, that investors in aggregate--repeat, aggregate--would earn in a world of constant interest rates, 2% inflation, and those ever hurtful frictional costs, it would be 6%. If you strip out the inflation component from this nominal return (which you would need to do however inflation fluctuates), that's 4% in real terms. And if 4% is wrong, I believe that the percentage is just as likely to be less as more.

<br>

让我回到我之前所说的：未来投资者在市场上实现显著利润的三个可能因素。第一个是利率可能下降，第二个是企业利润占GDP的比例可能大幅上升。现在我来谈谈第三点：也许你是一个乐观主义者，认为尽管投资者整体可能艰难前行，但你自己会是赢家。在信息革命（我完全相信）的初期，这个想法可能尤其诱人。你的经纪人会告诉你，只需选择明显的赢家，然后乘风破浪。

Let me come back to what I said earlier: that there are three things that might allow investors to realize significant profits in the market going forward. The first was that interest rates might fall, and the second was that corporate profits as a percent of GDP might rise dramatically. I get to the third point now: Perhaps you are an optimist who believes that though investors as a whole may slog along, you yourself will be a winner. That thought might be particularly seductive in these early days of the information revolution (which I wholeheartedly believe in). Just pick the obvious winners, your broker will tell you, and ride the wave.

<br>

好吧，我认为回顾一下本世纪早期改变了美国的几个行业会很有启发性：汽车和航空。首先谈谈汽车：在这里，我有一页，共计70页，介绍了在美国运营过的汽车和卡车制造商。曾经有一款伯克希尔汽车和一款奥马哈汽车。当然，我注意到了这些。但还有一整本电话簿的其他品牌。

Well, I thought it would be instructive to go back and look at a couple of industries that transformed this country much earlier in this century: automobiles and aviation. Take automobiles first: I have here one page, out of 70 in total, of car and truck manufacturers that have operated in this country. At one time, there was a Berkshire car and an Omaha car. Naturally I noticed those. But there was also a telephone book of others.

<br>

总的来说，似乎至少有2000个汽车品牌，这个行业对人们的生活产生了令人难以置信的影响。如果你在汽车早期预见到这个行业将如何发展，你会说，“这是通往财富的道路。”那么到了20世纪90年代，我们发展到了什么程度呢？在屠杀从未停止的企业浩劫之后，美国汽车公司只剩下了三家——而这三家对投资者来说也没有什么吸引力。所以，这是一个对美国产生了巨大影响的行业——同时也对投资者产生了巨大影响，尽管不是预期的那种影响。

All told, there appear to have been at least 2,000 car makes, in an industry that had an incredible impact on people's lives. If you had foreseen in the early days of cars how this industry would develop, you would have said, "Here is the road to riches." So what did we progress to by the 1990s? After corporate carnage that never let up, we came down to three U.S. car companies--themselves no lollapaloozas for investors. So here is an industry that had an enormous impact on America--and also an enormous impact, though not the anticipated one, on investors.

<br>

顺便说一下，有时在这些变革性事件中，找出输家要容易得多。当汽车出现时，你本可以领悟到它的重要性，但仍然难以挑选能让你赚钱的公司。但当时有一个明显的决定你本可以做出——有时把这些事情颠倒过来会更好——那就是做空马匹。坦率地说，我对巴菲特家族在整个时期都没有做空马匹感到失望。而且我们确实没有借口：生活在内布拉斯加州，我们本可以很容易地借到马匹，避免“做空挤压”。

Sometimes, incidentally, it's much easier in these transforming events to figure out the losers. You could have grasped the importance of the auto when it came along but still found it hard to pick companies that would make you money. But there was one obvious decision you could have made back then--it's better sometimes to turn these things upside down--and that was to short horses. Frankly, I'm disappointed that the Buffett family was not short horses through this entire period. And we really had no excuse: Living in Nebraska, we would have found it super-easy to borrow horses and avoid a "short squeeze."

<br>

美国马匹数量 1900年：2100万匹 1998年：500万匹

U.S. Horse Population 1900: 21 million 1998: 5 million

<br>

除汽车之外，20世纪第一个25年中另一个真正变革性的商业发明是飞机——这又是一个明显具有辉煌前景的行业，足以让投资者垂涎。因此，我回顾了飞机制造商的历史，发现在1919-1939年期间，有大约300家公司，如今仅有少数几家仍在运营。当时制造的飞机——我们一定是那个时代的硅谷——包括内布拉斯加和奥马哈两款飞机，即使是最忠诚的内布拉斯加州人如今也不再依赖它们。

The other truly transforming business invention of the first quarter of the century, besides the car, was the airplane--another industry whose plainly brilliant future would have caused investors to salivate. So I went back to check out aircraft manufacturers and found that in the 1919-39 period, there were about 300 companies, only a handful still breathing today. Among the planes made then--we must have been the Silicon Valley of that age--were both the Nebraska and the Omaha, two aircraft that even the most loyal Nebraskan no longer relies upon.

<br>

继续谈论航空公司的失败。以下是过去20年里申请破产的129家航空公司的名单。大陆航空公司足够聪明，竟然两次上榜。实际上，截至1992年——尽管此后情况有所改善——自航空业诞生以来，美国所有航空公司赚到的钱是零。绝对的零。

Move on to failures of airlines. Here's a list of 129 airlines that in the past 20 years filed for bankruptcy. Continental was smart enough to make that list twice. As of 1992, in fact--though the picture would have improved since then--the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country's airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero.

<br>

权衡这一切，我想如果1903年我在基蒂霍克见证奥维尔·莱特起飞时，我会有足够的远见和公益心——我对未来的资本家们负有这个责任——去击落他。我的意思是，卡尔·马克思对资本家们造成的损害都不如奥维尔大。

Sizing all this up, I like to think that if I'd been at Kitty Hawk in 1903 when Orville Wright took off, I would have been farsighted enough, and public-spirited enough--I owed this to future capitalists--to shoot him down. I mean, Karl Marx couldn't have done as much damage to capitalists as Orville did.

<br>

我不会详细论述其他改变了我们生活的璀璨产业，但同时未能给美国投资者带来回报的例子，例如无线电和电视制造业。但是我会从这些产业中得出一个教训：投资的关键并不在于评估一个行业将如何影响社会，或者它将增长多少，而在于判断任何特定公司的竞争优势，尤其是这种优势的持久性。那些拥有广泛、可持续护城河的产品或服务，才是能够给投资者带来回报的。

I won't dwell on other glamorous businesses that dramatically changed our lives but concurrently failed to deliver rewards to U.S. investors: the manufacture of radios and televisions, for example. But I will draw a lesson from these businesses: The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.

<br>

谈到17年周期，让我想起了（虽然我承认这有点不相关）17年蝉。假如现在有一批预计在2016年出现的这些小家伙，它们能预期遇到什么呢？我看到它们进入一个股票市场中公众的狂热程度低于现在的世界。自然地，投资者会感到失望——但这仅仅是因为他们一开始期望过高。

This talk of 17-year periods makes me think--incongruously, I admit--of 17-year locusts. What could a current brood of these critters, scheduled to take flight in 2016, expect to encounter? I see them entering a world in which the public is less euphoric about stocks than it is now. Naturally, investors will be feeling disappointment--but only because they started out expecting too much.

<br>

无论他们是否心情不好，到那时他们都会变得相当富有，仅仅是因为他们所拥有的美国企业机构一直在稳步前进，在实际意义上每年将利润提高3%。最重要的是，这种财富创造带来的回报将惠及普通美国人，他们将享有远高于今天的生活水平。即使这种情况不能与过去17年的投资者习惯相比，这个世界也不会太糟。

Grumpy or not, they will have by then grown considerably wealthier, simply because the American business establishment that they own will have been chugging along, increasing its profits by 3% annually in real terms. Best of all, the rewards from this creation of wealth will have flowed through to Americans in general, who will be enjoying a far higher standard of living than they do today. That wouldn't be a bad world at all--even if it doesn't measure up to what investors got used to in the 17 years just passed.
